She gave Faith to understand that she had disgraced herself and her father beyond redemption and that she, Mary Vance, was done with her. &ldquo;Everybody&rdquo; was talking, and &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; said the same thing.</p><p>&ldquo;I simply feel that I can&rsquo;t associate with you any longer,&rdquo; she concluded.</p><p>&ldquo;WE are going to associate with her then,&rdquo; cried Nan Blythe. Nan secretly thought Faith HAD done a awful thing, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to let Mary Vance run matters in this high-handed fashion. &ldquo;And if YOU are not you needn&rsquo;t come any more to Rainbow Valley, MISS Vance.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
