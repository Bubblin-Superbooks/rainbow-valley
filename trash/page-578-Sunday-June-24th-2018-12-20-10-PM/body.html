<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But I&rsquo;d LIKE to do it. I&rsquo;d like to call a meeting of the Ladies Aid and W.M.S. and the Girls Sewing Society, and include in the audience all and any Methodists who have been criticizing the Merediths&mdash;although I do think if we Presbyterians stopped criticizing and excusing we would find that other denominations would trouble themselves very little about our manse folks. I would say to them, &lsquo;Dear Christian friends&rsquo;&mdash;with marked emphasis on &lsquo;Christian&rsquo;&mdash;I have something to say to you and I want to say it good and hard, that you may take it home and repeat it to your families. You Methodists need not pity us, and we Presbyterians need not pity ourselves. We are not going to do it any more. And we are going to say, boldly and truthfully, to all critics and sympathizers, &lsquo;We are PROUD of our minister and his family.</p></div> </div>
