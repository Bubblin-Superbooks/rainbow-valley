NOW we both have a pair. You know perfectly well, Una, that father said in his sermon last Sunday that there was no real happiness in getting or having&mdash;only in giving. And it&rsquo;s true. I feel FAR happier now than I ever did in my whole life before. Just think of Lida walking home this very minute with her poor little feet all nice and warm and comfy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know you haven&rsquo;t another pair of black cashmere stockings,&rdquo; said Una.</p></div> </div>
