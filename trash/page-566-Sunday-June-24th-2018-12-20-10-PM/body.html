If anybody is in the garden at the time&mdash;I THINK I&rsquo;ll come on an evening just like this, but it MIGHT be just at dawn&mdash;a lovely, pale-pinky spring dawn&mdash;they&rsquo;ll just see the daffodils nodding wildly as if an extra gust of wind had blown past them, but it will be I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mrs. Dr. dear, you will not be thinking of flaunting worldly things like daffies after you are dead,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;And I do NOT believe in ghosts, seen or unseen.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
