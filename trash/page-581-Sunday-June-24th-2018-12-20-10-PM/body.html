<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Anne Blythe, I wish you WOULD call that meeting and say just that! You&rsquo;ve made me ashamed of myself, for one, and far be it from me to refuse to admit it. OF COURSE, that is how we should have talked&mdash;especially to the Methodists. And it&rsquo;s every word of it true&mdash;every word. We&rsquo;ve just been shutting our eyes to the big worth-while things and squinting them on the little things that don&rsquo;t really matter a pin&rsquo;s worth. Oh, Anne dearie, I can see a thing when it&rsquo;s hammered into my head. No more apologizing for Cornelia Marshall! I shall hold MY head up after this, believe ME&mdash;though I MAY talk things over with you as usual just to relieve my feelings if the Merediths do any more startling stunts. Even that letter I felt so bad about&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s only a good joke after all, as Norman says.</p></div> </div>
