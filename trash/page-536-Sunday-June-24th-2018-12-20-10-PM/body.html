<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wear those striped stockings,&rdquo; said Faith stubbornly. &ldquo;The feel of them is even worse than the looks. They make me feel as if my legs were as big as barrels and they&rsquo;re so SCRATCHY.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If father was home I&rsquo;d go and ask him to get me a new pair before the store closes. But he won&rsquo;t be home till too late. I&rsquo;ll ask him Monday&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t go to church tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll pretend I&rsquo;m sick and Aunt Martha&rsquo;ll HAVE to let me stay home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
