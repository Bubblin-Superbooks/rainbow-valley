<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jem was not there. Jem spent his evenings now studying for his entrance examination in the Ingleside garret. Jerry was down near the pond, trouting. Walter had been reading Longfellow&rsquo;s sea poems to the others and they were steeped in the beauty and mystery of the ships. Then they talked of what they would do when they were grown up&mdash;where they would travel&mdash;the far, fair shores they would see. Nan and Di meant to go to Europe. Walter longed for the Nile moaning past its Egyptian sands, and a glimpse of the sphinx. Faith opined rather dismally that she supposed she would have to be a missionary&mdash;old Mrs. Taylor told her she ought to be&mdash;and then she would at least see India or China, those mysterious lands of the Orient. Carl&rsquo;s heart was set on African jungles. Una said nothing. She thought she would just like to stay at home. It was prettier here than anywhere else.</p></div> </div>
