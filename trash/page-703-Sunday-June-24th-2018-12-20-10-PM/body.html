<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Walter had been reading again that day in his beloved book of myths and he remembered how he had once fancied the Pied Piper coming down the valley on an evening just like this.</p><p>He began to speak dreamily, partly because he wanted to thrill his companions a little, partly because something apart from him seemed to be speaking through his lips.</p><p>&ldquo;The Piper is coming nearer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he is nearer than he was that evening I saw him before. His long, shadowy cloak is blowing around him. He pipes&mdash;he pipes&mdash;and we must follow&mdash;Jem and Carl and Jerry and I&mdash;round and round the world. Listen&mdash;listen&mdash;can&rsquo;t you hear his wild music?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
