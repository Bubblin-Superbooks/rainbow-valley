But I&rsquo;m afraid it was Carl that put the eel in old Mrs. Carr&rsquo;s buggy, though I said at first I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it until I&rsquo;d better proof than old Kitty Alec&rsquo;s word. I told Mrs. Elliott so right to her face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did Carl do?&rdquo; cried Faith.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they say&mdash;now, mind, I&rsquo;m only telling you what people say&mdash;so there&rsquo;s no use in your blaming me for it&mdash;that Carl and a lot of other boys were fishing eels over the bridge one evening last week. Mrs. Carr drove past in that old rattletrap buggy of hers with the open back. And Carl he just up and threw a big eel into the back.</p></div> </div>
