All I had was wore out by the time winter was over,&rdquo; said Lida indifferently.</p><p>For a moment Faith stated in horror. This was terrible. Here was a little girl, almost a neighbour, half frozen because she had no shoes or stockings in this cruel spring weather. Impulsive Faith thought of nothing but the dreadfulness of it. In a moment she was pulling off her own shoes and stockings.</p><p>&ldquo;Here, take these and put them right on,&rdquo; she said, forcing them into the hands of the astonished Lida. &ldquo;Quick now.
