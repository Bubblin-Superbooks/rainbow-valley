Why, they say he knows nothing about that letter of Faith&rsquo;s to the JOURNAL because nobody liked to mention it to him. He never looks at a JOURNAL of course. But I thought he ought to know of this to prevent any such performances in future. He said he would &lsquo;discuss it with them.&rsquo; But of course he&rsquo;d never think of it again after he got out of our gate. That man has no sense of humour, Anne, believe ME. He preached last Sunday on &lsquo;How to Bring up Children.&rsquo; A beautiful sermon it was, too&mdash;and everybody in church thinking &lsquo;what a pity you can&rsquo;t practise what you preach.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
