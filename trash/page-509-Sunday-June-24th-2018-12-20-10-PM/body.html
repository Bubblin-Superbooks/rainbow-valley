<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been talking about you now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everybody&mdash;so Mary Vance says.&rdquo; And Faith poured out her troubles to sympathetic Jem. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she concluded dolefully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve nobody to bring us up. And so we get into scrapes and people think we&rsquo;re bad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring yourselves up?&rdquo; suggested Jem. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. Form a Good-Conduct Club and punish yourselves every time you do anything that&rsquo;s not right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Faith, struck by it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added doubtfully, &ldquo;things that don&rsquo;t seem a bit of harm to US seem simply dreadful to other people. How can we tell? We can&rsquo;t be bothering father all the time&mdash;and he has to be away a lot, anyhow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
