<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How frail Una had looked, lying there on the vestry sofa in that long faint! How thin were her tiny hands, how pallid her little face! She looked as if she might slip away from him in a breath&mdash;sweet little Una, of whom Cecilia had begged him to take such special care. Since his wife&rsquo;s death he had not felt such an agony of dread as when he had hung over his little girl in her unconsciousness. He must do something&mdash;but what? Should he ask Elizabeth Kirk to marry him? She was a good woman&mdash;she would be kind to his children. He might bring himself to do it if it were not for his love for Rosemary West. But until he had crushed that out he could not seek another woman in marriage. And he could not crush it out&mdash;he had tried and he could not. Rosemary had been in church that evening, for the first time since her return from Kingsport.</p></div> </div>
