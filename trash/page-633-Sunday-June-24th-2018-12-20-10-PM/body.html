<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should be punished at all,&rdquo; said Faith, rather sulkily. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. We couldn&rsquo;t help being frightened. And it won&rsquo;t do father any harm. It was just an accident.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were cowards,&rdquo; said Jerry with judicial scorn, &ldquo;and you gave way to your cowardice. That is why you should be punished. Everybody will laugh at you about this, and that is a disgrace to the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you knew how awful the whole thing was,&rdquo; said Faith with a shiver, &ldquo;you would think we had been punished enough already. I wouldn&rsquo;t go through it again for anything in the whole world.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
