<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The concert was my idea, Father,&rdquo; said Faith, afraid that Mr. Meredith might blame Jerry too much. &ldquo;You know the Methodists themselves had a sacred concert in their church three Sunday nights ago. I thought it would be good fun to get one up in imitation of it. Only they had prayers at theirs, and we left that part out, because we heard that people thought it awful for us to pray in a graveyard. YOU were sitting in here all the time,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and never said a word to us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not notice what you were doing. That is no excuse for me, of course. I am more to blame than you&mdash;I realize that. But why did you sing that foolish song at the end?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
