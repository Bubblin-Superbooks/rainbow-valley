It wasn&rsquo;t WRONG and it didn&rsquo;t hurt anybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will hurt Dad. You KNOW it will. You know people blame him whenever we do anything queer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that,&rdquo; muttered Faith.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble. You didn&rsquo;t think and you SHOULD have thought. That&rsquo;s what our Club is for&mdash;to bring us up and MAKE us think. We promised we&rsquo;d always stop and think before doing things. You didn&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;ve got to be punished, Faith&mdash;and real hard, too. You&rsquo;ll wear those striped stockings to school for a week for punishment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
