She stared at Una blankly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be angry, please, dear Miss West,&rdquo; said Una, pleadingly. &ldquo;You see, everybody is saying that you wouldn&rsquo;t marry father because we are so bad. He is VERY unhappy about it. So I thought I would come and tell you that we are never bad ON PURPOSE. And if you will only marry father we will all try to be good and do just what you tell us. I&rsquo;m SURE you won&rsquo;t have any trouble with us. PLEASE, Miss West.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
