<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When poor old Mrs. Carr was driving up the hill by Ingleside that eel came squirming out between her feet. She thought it was a snake and she just give one awful screech and stood up and jumped clean over the wheels. The horse bolted, but it went home and no damage was done. But Mrs. Carr jarred her legs most terrible, and has had nervous spasms ever since whenever she thinks of the eel. Say, it was a rotten trick to play on the poor old soul. She&rsquo;s a decent body, if she is as queer as Dick&rsquo;s hat band.&rdquo;</p><p>Faith and Una looked at each other again. This was a matter for the Good-Conduct Club. They would not talk it over with Mary.</p></div> </div>
