We sang hymns&mdash;it was a sacred concert, you know. What harm was that? I tell you we never thought about it&rsquo;s being Methodist prayer meeting night. They used to have their meeting Tuesday nights and since they&rsquo;ve changed to Thursdays it&rsquo;s hard to remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sing nothing but hymns?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Jerry, turning red, &ldquo;we DID sing Polly Wolly Doodle at the last. Faith said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have something cheerful to wind up with.&rsquo; But we didn&rsquo;t mean any harm, Father&mdash;truly we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
