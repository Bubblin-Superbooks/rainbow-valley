<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And I think you ought to know you&rsquo;ve spoiled your pa&rsquo;s match and I think it&rsquo;s a pity, for he&rsquo;s bound to marry somebody before long, and Rosemary West would have been the best wife I know of for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me all stepmothers were cruel and wicked,&rdquo; said Una.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well,&rdquo; said Mary rather confusedly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re mostly awful cranky, I know. But Rosemary West couldn&rsquo;t be very mean to any one. I tell you if your pa turns round and marries Emmeline Drew you&rsquo;ll wish you&rsquo;d behaved yourselves better and not frightened Rosemary out of it. It&rsquo;s awful that you&rsquo;ve got such a reputation that no decent woman&rsquo;ll marry your pa on account of you. Of course, I know that half the yarns that are told about you ain&rsquo;t true. But give a dog a bad name.</p></div> </div>
