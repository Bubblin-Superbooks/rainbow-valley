<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Una always felt very close to her mother there&mdash;as if she were kneeling at her feet with head in her lap. She went there once in a long while when life was TOO hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she whispered to the gray silk gown, &ldquo;I will never forget you, mother, and I&rsquo;ll ALWAYS love you best. But I have to do it, mother, because father is so very unhappy. I know you wouldn&rsquo;t want him to be unhappy. And I will be very good to her, mother, and try to love her, even if she is like Mary Vance said stepmothers always were.&rdquo;</p><p>Una carried some fine, spiritual strength away from her secret shrine. She slept peacefully that night with the tear stains still glistening on her sweet, serious, little face.</p></div> </div>
