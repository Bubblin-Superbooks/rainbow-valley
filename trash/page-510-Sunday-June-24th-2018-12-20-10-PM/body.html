Mother says you&rsquo;re all too impulsive, just as she used to be. The Good-Conduct Club would help you to think, if you were fair and honest about punishing yourselves when you broke the rules. You&rsquo;d have to punish in some way that really HURT, or it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whip each other?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not exactly. You&rsquo;d have to think up different ways of punishment to suit the person. You wouldn&rsquo;t punish each other&mdash;you&rsquo;d punish YOURSELVES. I read all about such a club in a story-book. You try it and see how it works.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
