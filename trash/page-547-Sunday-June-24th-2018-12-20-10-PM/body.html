<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Never shall I forget my sensations, Mrs. Dr. dear, when I saw a minister&rsquo;s child walking up the aisle of our church with no stockings on. I really did not know what way to look.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the church was just full of Methodists yesterday, too,&rdquo; groaned Miss Cornelia, who had come up to the Glen to do some shopping and run into Ingleside to talk the affair over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but just as sure as those manse children do something especially awful the church is sure to be crowded with Methodists. I thought Mrs. Deacon Hazard&rsquo;s eyes would drop out of her head. When she came out of church she said, &lsquo;Well, that exhibition was no more than decent. I do pity the Presbyterians.&rsquo; And we just had to TAKE it. There was nothing one could say.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
