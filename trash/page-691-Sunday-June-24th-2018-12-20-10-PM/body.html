<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I don&rsquo;t want to take your own mother&rsquo;s place&mdash;she must always have that in your hearts. But neither have I any intention of being a stepmother. I want to be your friend and helper and CHUM. Don&rsquo;t you think that would be nice, Una&mdash;if you and Faith and Carl and Jerry could just think of me as a good jolly chum&mdash;a big older sister?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it would be lovely,&rdquo; cried Una, with a transfigured face. She flung her arms impulsively round Rosemary&rsquo;s neck. She was so happy that she felt as if she could fly on wings.</p><p>&ldquo;Do the others&mdash;do Faith and the boys have the same idea you had about stepmothers?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
