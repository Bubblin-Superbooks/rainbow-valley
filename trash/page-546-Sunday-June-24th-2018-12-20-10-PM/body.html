<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Susan could not immediately begin knitting stockings for Faith because it was Sunday, but she had one set up before any one else was out of bed at Ingleside the next morning.</p><p>&ldquo;You need not tell me anything but that it was old Martha&rsquo;s fault, Mrs. Dr. dear.&rdquo; she told Anne. &ldquo;I suppose that poor little child had no decent stockings to wear. I suppose every stocking she had was in holes, as you know very well they generally are. And I think, Mrs. Dr. dear, that the Ladies&rsquo; Aid would be better employed in knitting some for them than in fighting over the new carpet for the pulpit platform. I am not a Ladies&rsquo; Aider, but I shall knit Faith two pairs of stockings, out of this nice black yarn, as fast as my fingers can move and that you may tie to.</p></div> </div>
