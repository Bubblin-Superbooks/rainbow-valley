That was thirty years ago, but Henry Warren&rsquo;s ghost ha&rsquo;nts it yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; asked Nan scornfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, GOOD people have seen him&mdash;and heard him.&rdquo; retorted Mary. &ldquo;They say he appears and grovels on the ground and holds you by the legs and gibbers and moans like he did when he was alive. I thought of that as soon as I seen that white thing in the bushes and thought if it caught me like that and moaned I&rsquo;d drop down dead on the spot. So I cut and run. It MIGHTN&rsquo;T have been his ghost, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to take any chances with a ha&rsquo;nt.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
