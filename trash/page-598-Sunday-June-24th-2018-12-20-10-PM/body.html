<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the point,&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t take the easiest day to fast, but the hardest&mdash;and that&rsquo;s Sunday, because, as you say, we mostly have roast beef that day instead of cold ditto. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much punishment to fast from ditto. Let&rsquo;s take next Sunday. It will be a good day, for father is going to exchange for the morning service with the Upper Lowbridge minister. Father will be away till evening. If Aunt Martha wonders what&rsquo;s got into us, we&rsquo;ll tell her right up that we&rsquo;re fasting for the good of our souls, and it is in the Bible and she is not to interfere, and I guess she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
