<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nan and Di both put their arms around Faith and glared defiance at Mary. The latter suddenly crumpled up, sat down on a stump and began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;But if I keep in with Faith people&rsquo;ll be saying I put her up to doing things. Some are saying it now, true&rsquo;s you live. I can&rsquo;t afford to have such things said of me, now that I&rsquo;m in a respectable place and trying to be a lady. And I never went bare-legged in church in my toughest days. I&rsquo;d never have thought of doing such a thing. But that hateful old Kitty Alec says Faith has never been the same girl since that time I stayed in the manse. She says Cornelia Elliott will live to rue the day she took me in. It hurts my feelings, I tell you. But it&rsquo;s Mr. Meredith I&rsquo;m really worried over.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
