Lida was furnished forth for the summer. She had no qualms in the matter. In her eyes the manse people were quite fabulously rich, and no doubt those girls had slathers of shoes and stockings. Then Lida ran down to the Glen village and played for an hour with the boys before Mr. Flagg&rsquo;s store, splashing about in a pool of slush with the maddest of them, until Mrs. Elliott came along and bade her begone home.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, Faith, that you should have done that,&rdquo; said Una, a little reproachfully, after Lida had gone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wear your good boots every day now and they&rsquo;ll soon scuff out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
