What would father say if he knew? Don&rsquo;t you remember how he talked to us after mother died and told us we must always be TRUE, no matter what else we failed in. He said we must never tell or act a lie&mdash;he said he&rsquo;d TRUST us not to. You CAN&rsquo;T do it, Faith. Just wear the striped stockings. It&rsquo;ll only be for once. Nobody will notice them in church. It isn&rsquo;t like school. And your new brown dress is so long they won&rsquo;t show much. Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky Aunt Martha made it big, so you&rsquo;d have room to grow in it, for all you hated it so when she finished it?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
