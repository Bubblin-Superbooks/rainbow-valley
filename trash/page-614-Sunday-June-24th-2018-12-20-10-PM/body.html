He was an awful old rip, they say, and his wife wasn&rsquo;t much better. They&rsquo;d no children of their own, but a sister of old Tom&rsquo;s died and left a little boy&mdash;this Henry Warren&mdash;and they took him. He was about twelve when he came to them, and kind of undersized and delicate. They say Tom and his wife used him awful from the start&mdash;whipped him and starved him. Folks said they wanted him to die so&rsquo;s they could get the little bit of money his mother had left for him. Henry didn&rsquo;t die right off, but he begun having fits&mdash;epileps, they called &lsquo;em&mdash;and he grew up kind of simple, till he was about eighteen.</p></div> </div>
