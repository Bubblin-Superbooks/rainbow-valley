<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s away, Anne dearie&mdash;he&rsquo;s been away to New Brunswick for a week. And that young scalawag of a Joe Vickers is editing the Journal in his absence. Of course, Mr. Vickers would never have put it in, even if he is a Methodist, but Joe would just think it a good joke. As you say, I don&rsquo;t suppose there is anything to be done now, only live it down. But if I ever get Joe Vickers cornered somewhere I&rsquo;ll give him a talking to he won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry. I wanted Marshall to stop our subscription to the Journal instantly, but he only laughed and said that to-day&rsquo;s issue was the only one that had had anything readable in it for a year. Marshall never will take anything seriously&mdash;just like a man. Fortunately, Evan Boyd is like that, too. He takes it as a joke and is laughing all over the place about it.</p></div> </div>
