Did you never tell a lie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heaps of &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said Mary.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dreadful sin,&rdquo; said Una solemnly.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; demanded Mary, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d be sent to hell for telling a lie now and then? Why, I HAD to. Mr. Wiley would have broken every bone in my body one time if I hadn&rsquo;t told him a lie. Lies have saved me many a whack, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>Una sighed. Here were too many difficulties for her to solve. She shuddered as she thought of being cruelly whipped. Very likely she would have lied too. She squeezed Mary&rsquo;s little calloused hand.</p></div> </div>
