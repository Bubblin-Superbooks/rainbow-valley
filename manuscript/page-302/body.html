He turned up the marriage service and got through with it, but the bride never felt quite properly married for the rest of her life.</p><p>He forgot his prayer-meeting again&mdash;but that did not matter, for it was a wet night and nobody came. He might even have forgotten his Sunday service if it had not been for Mrs. Alec Davis. Aunt Martha came in on Saturday afternoon and told him that Mrs. Davis was in the parlour and wanted to see him. Mr. Meredith sighed.
