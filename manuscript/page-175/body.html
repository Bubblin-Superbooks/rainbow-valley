I always feel so sorry for the poor little lame boy who couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the others and got shut out of the mountain. He must have been so disappointed. I think all the rest of his life he&rsquo;d be wondering what wonderful thing he had missed and wishing he could have got in with the others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how glad his mother must have been,&rdquo; said Una softly. &ldquo;I think she had been sorry all her life that he was lame. Perhaps she even used to cry about it. But she would never be sorry again&mdash;never. She would be glad he was lame because that was why she hadn&rsquo;t lost him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
