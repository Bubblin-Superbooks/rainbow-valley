I expect it&rsquo;s ruined your father in this congregation. He&rsquo;ll never be able to live it down, poor man! Everybody blames him for it, and that isn&rsquo;t fair. But nothing IS fair in this world. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What HAVE we done?&rdquo; asked Una again, despairingly. Faith said nothing, but her eyes flashed golden-brown scorn at Mary.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t pretend innocence,&rdquo; said Mary, witheringly. &ldquo;Everybody knows what you have done.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
