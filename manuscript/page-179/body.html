<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; said Walter dreamily, looking afar into the sky, &ldquo;the Pied Piper will come over the hill up there and down Rainbow Valley, piping merrily and sweetly. And I will follow him&mdash;follow him down to the shore&mdash;down to the sea&mdash;away from you all. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll want to go&mdash;Jem will want to go&mdash;it will be such an adventure&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t. Only I&rsquo;ll HAVE to&mdash;the music will call and call and call me until I MUST follow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; cried Di, catching fire at the flame of Walter&rsquo;s fancy, and half-believing she could see the mocking, retreating figure of the mystic piper in the far, dim end of the valley.</p></div> </div>
