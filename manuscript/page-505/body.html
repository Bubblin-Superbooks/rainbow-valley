<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Jem was beginning to grow away from them somewhat this spring. He was studying for the entrance examination of Queen&rsquo;s Academy and stayed after school with the older pupils for extra lessons. Also, his evenings were so full of work that he seldom joined the others in Rainbow Valley now. He seemed to be drifting away into grown-up land.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you all to-night?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fun in you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; agreed Faith dolefully. &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be much fun in you either if YOU knew you were disgracing your father and making people talk about you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
