She would NOT talk to this&mdash;this creature.</p><p>&ldquo;You should try to put them in order,&rdquo; Mr. Perry went on, playing with his handsome watch chain and smiling patronizingly on Faith. &ldquo;You are quite old enough to attend to such duties. MY little daughter at home is only ten and she is already an excellent little housekeeper and the greatest help and comfort to her mother. She is a very sweet child. I wish you had the privilege of her acquaintance. She could help you in many ways. Of course, you have not had the inestimable privilege of a good mother&rsquo;s care and training.
