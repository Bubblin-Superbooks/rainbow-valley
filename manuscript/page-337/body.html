She flew to Rainbow Valley with a heart as light as her heels, and in the course of conversation told Faith Meredith all about Mrs. Alec Davis.</p><p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Elliott says that she&rsquo;ll turn all the Douglases against your father and then he&rsquo;ll have to leave the Glen because his salary won&rsquo;t be paid,&rdquo; concluded Mary. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is to be done, honest to goodness. If only old Norman Douglas would come back to church and pay, it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad.
