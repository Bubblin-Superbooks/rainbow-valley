Norman Douglas didn&rsquo;t get the woman he wanted thirty years ago and the Douglases never liked to put up with second best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was the woman he did want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ellen West. They weren&rsquo;t engaged exactly, I believe, but they went about together for two years. And then they just broke off&mdash;nobody ever know why. Just some silly quarrel, I suppose. And Norman went and married Hester Reese before his temper had time to cool&mdash;married her just to spite Ellen, I haven&rsquo;t a doubt. So like a man! Hester was a nice little thing, but she never had much spirit and he broke what little she had. She was too meek for Norman. He needed a woman who could stand up to him.</p></div> </div>
