Mary said its tail was too short. Faith angrily retorted that she guessed God know what length to make a rooster&rsquo;s tail. They did not &ldquo;speak&rdquo; for a day over this. Mary treated Una&rsquo;s hairless, one-eyed doll with consideration; but when Una showed her other prized treasure&mdash;a picture of an angel carrying a baby, presumably to heaven, Mary declared that it looked too much like a ghost for her. Una crept away to her room and cried over this, but Mary hunted her out, hugged her repentantly and implored forgiveness. No one could keep up a quarrel long with Mary&mdash;not even Nan, who was rather prone to hold grudges and never quite forgave the insult to her mother. Mary was jolly.</p></div> </div>
