He didn&rsquo;t think Walter would fight, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have called names before him. Oh, if you could just have seen Walter&rsquo;s face when he looked at him, Una! It made me shiver&mdash;with a nice shiver. He looked just like Sir Galahad in that poem father read us on Saturday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate the thought of them fighting and I wish it could be stopped,&rdquo; said Una.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s got to go on now,&rdquo; cried Faith. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of honour. Don&rsquo;t you DARE tell anyone, Una. If you do I&rsquo;ll never tell you secrets again!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
