You&rsquo;ve been told often enough you shouldn&rsquo;t play in the graveyard. The Methodists are sensitive about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We forget,&rdquo; said Faith dolefully. &ldquo;And the lawn is so small&mdash;and so caterpillary&mdash;and so full of shrubs and things. We can&rsquo;t be in Rainbow Valley all the time&mdash;and where are we to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the things you DO in the graveyard. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if you just sat here and talked quiet, same as we&rsquo;re doing now. Well, I don&rsquo;t know what is going to come of it all, but I DO know that Elder Warren is going to speak to your pa about it. Deacon Hazard is his cousin.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
