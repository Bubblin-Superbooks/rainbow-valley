<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No. Faith never believed Mary Vance. I was dreadfully foolish to believe her, either. Faith loves you already&mdash;she has loved you ever since poor Adam was eaten. And Jerry and Carl will think it is jolly. Oh, Miss West, when you come to live with us, will you&mdash;could you&mdash;teach me to cook&mdash;a little&mdash;and sew&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and do things? I don&rsquo;t know anything. I won&rsquo;t be much trouble&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try to learn fast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darling, I&rsquo;ll teach you and help you all I can. Now, you won&rsquo;t say a word to anybody about this, will you&mdash;not even to Faith, until your father himself tells you you may? And you&rsquo;ll stay and have tea with me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
