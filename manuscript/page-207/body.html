Una hesitated between an old beaded purse and a gay picture of Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den, and finally offered Mary her choice. Mary really hankered after the beaded purse, but she knew Una loved it, so she said,</p><p>&ldquo;Give me Daniel. I&rsquo;d rusher have it &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m partial to lions. Only I wish they&rsquo;d et Daniel up. It would have been more exciting.&rdquo;</p><p>At bedtime Mary coaxed Una to sleep with her.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the last time,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s raining tonight, and I hate sleeping up there alone when it&rsquo;s raining on account of that graveyard.</p></div> </div>
