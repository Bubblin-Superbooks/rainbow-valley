<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Too bad. I like sermons on that subject. You tell him that if he wants to keep me in good humour to preach a good rip-roaring sermon on hell once every six months&mdash;and the more brimstone the better. I like &lsquo;em smoking. And think of all the pleasure he&rsquo;d give the old maids, too. They&rsquo;d all keep looking at old Norman Douglas and thinking, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for you, you old reprobate. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in store for YOU!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give an extra ten dollars every time you get your father to preach on hell. Here&rsquo;s Wilson and the jam. Like that, hey? IT isn&rsquo;t macanaccady. Taste!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
