She had brought them up a dozen eggs and a little pail of milk&mdash;a VERY little pail, Mrs. Dr. dear. Faith took them and whisked down the cellar with them. Near the bottom of the stairs she caught her toe and fell the rest of the way, milk and eggs and all. You can imagine the result, Mrs. Dr. dear. But that child came up laughing. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m myself or a custard pie,&rsquo; she said. And Mrs. James Millison was very angry. She said she would never take another thing to the manse if it was to be wasted and destroyed in that fashion.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
