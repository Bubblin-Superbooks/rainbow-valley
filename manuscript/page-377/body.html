<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Kept my word, you see&mdash;kept my word, Red Rose. I&rsquo;m free now till the first Sunday in December. Fine sermon, girl&mdash;fine sermon. Your father has more in his head than he carries on his face. But he contradicted himself once&mdash;tell him he contradicted himself. And tell him I want that brimstone sermon in December. Great way to wind up the old year&mdash;with a taste of hell, you know. And what&rsquo;s the matter with a nice tasty discourse on heaven for New Year&rsquo;s? Though it wouldn&rsquo;t be half as interesting as hell, girl&mdash;not half. Only I&rsquo;d like to know what your father thinks about heaven&mdash;he CAN think&mdash;rarest thing in the world&mdash;a person who can think. But he DID contradict himself. Ha, ha! Here&rsquo;s a question you might ask him sometime when he&rsquo;s awake, girl.</p></div> </div>
