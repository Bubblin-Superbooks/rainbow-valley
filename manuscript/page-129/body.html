<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s right to be. The bible tells us to be kind to everybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it? Well, I guess most folks don&rsquo;t mind it much then. I never remember of any one being kind to me before&mdash;true&rsquo;s you live I don&rsquo;t. Say, Una, ain&rsquo;t them shadows on the walls pretty? They look just like a flock of little dancing birds. And say, Una, I like all you folks and them Blythe boys and Di, but I don&rsquo;t like that Nan. She&rsquo;s a proud one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mary, she isn&rsquo;t a bit proud,&rdquo; said Una eagerly. &ldquo;Not a single bit.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
