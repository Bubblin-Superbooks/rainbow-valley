Her tender heart was wrung with sympathy.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Carl, are you much scared?&rdquo; she whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Carl airily.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sleep a wink till after twelve,&rdquo; said Una. &ldquo;If you get lonesome just look up at our window and remember that I&rsquo;m inside, awake, and thinking about you. That will be a little company, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right. Don&rsquo;t you worry about me,&rdquo; said Carl.</p></div> </div>
