Anne dearie, believe me, the state of that manse is something terrible. Everything is thick with dust and nothing is ever in its place. And we had painted and papered it all so nice before they came.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are four children, you say?&rdquo; asked Anne, beginning to mother them already in her heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. They run up just like the steps of a stair. Gerald&rsquo;s the oldest. He&rsquo;s twelve and they call him Jerry. He&rsquo;s a clever boy. Faith is eleven.
