The manse children heard of Avonlea and Green Gables, of Rainbow Valley traditions, and of the little house by the harbour shore where Jem had been born. The Ingleside children heard of Maywater, where the Merediths had lived before coming to the Glen, of Una&rsquo;s beloved, one-eyed doll and Faith&rsquo;s pet rooster.</p><p>Faith was inclined to resent the fact that people laughed at her for petting a rooster. She liked the Blythes because they accepted it without question.</p><p>&ldquo;A handsome rooster like Adam is just as nice a pet as a dog or cat, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If he was a canary nobody would wonder. And I brought him up from a little, wee, yellow chicken. Mrs. Johnson at Maywater gave him to me. A weasel had killed all his brothers and sisters. I called him after her husband. I never liked dolls or cats. Cats are too sneaky and dolls are DEAD.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
