I haven&rsquo;t caught them at it here yet, but I would not approve of taking Mrs. Jamieson into the Sunday School. Yet we must not offend them. We are losing too many people, by death or bad temper. Mrs. Alec Davis has left the church, no one knows why. She told the managers that she would never pay another cent to Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s salary. Of course, most people say that the children offended her, but somehow I don&rsquo;t think so. I tried to pump Faith, but all I could get out of her was that Mrs. Davis had come, seemingly in high good humour, to see her father, and had left in an awful rage, calling them all &lsquo;varmints!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
