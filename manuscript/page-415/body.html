<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Say, this is great gum. Listen to me cracking it. There ain&rsquo;t any gum spruces down at Four Winds,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Sometimes I just hanker after a chew. Mrs. Elliott won&rsquo;t let me chew gum if she sees me. She says it ain&rsquo;t lady-like. This lady-business puzzles me. I can&rsquo;t get on to all its kinks. Say, Una, what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Cat got your tongue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Una, who could not drag her fascinated eyes from that squirrel muff. Mary leaned past her, picked it up and thrust it into Una&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Stick your paws in that for a while,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;They look sorter pinched. Ain&rsquo;t that a dandy muff? Mrs. Elliott give it to me last week for a birthday present. I&rsquo;m to get the collar at Christmas. I heard her telling Mr. Elliott that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
