<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Where are the other children?&rdquo; asked Miss Cornelia, when the first greetings&mdash;cordial on her side, rapturous on Anne&rsquo;s, and dignified on Susan&rsquo;s&mdash;were over.</p><p>&ldquo;Shirley is in bed and Jem and Walter and the twins are down in their beloved Rainbow Valley,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;They just came home this afternoon, you know, and they could hardly wait until supper was over before rushing down to the valley. They love it above every spot on earth. Even the maple grove doesn&rsquo;t rival it in their affections.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am afraid they love it too well,&rdquo; said Susan gloomily. &ldquo;Little Jem said once he would rather go to Rainbow Valley than to heaven when he died, and that was not a proper remark.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
