Yes, Saint, I expect we are in for a few unpleasant foggy days. Well, we&rsquo;ll weather them through, George. We&rsquo;ve dealt with foolish children before, Saint. Rosemary&rsquo;ll sulk a while&mdash;and then she&rsquo;ll get over it&mdash;and all will be as before, George. She promised&mdash;and she&rsquo;s got to keep her promise. And that&rsquo;s the last word on the subject I&rsquo;ll say to you or her or anyone, Saint.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
