Then she shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose my praying had anything to do with that?&rdquo; she cried imploringly to Una. &ldquo;If it had I&rsquo;ll never pray again as long as I live. Why, she may come back and ha&rsquo;nt me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, Mary,&rdquo; said Una comfortingly, &ldquo;it hadn&rsquo;t. Why, Mrs. Wiley died long before you ever began to pray about it at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Mary recovering from her panic. &ldquo;But I tell you it gave me a start. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to think I&rsquo;d prayed anybody to death. I never thought of such a thing as her dying when I was praying. She didn&rsquo;t seem much like the dying kind. Did Mrs. Elliott say anything about me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
