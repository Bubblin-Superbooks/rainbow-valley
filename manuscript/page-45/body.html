<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rosemary was engaged once, you know&mdash;to young Martin Crawford. His ship was wrecked on the Magdalens and all the crew were drowned. Rosemary was just a child&mdash;only seventeen. But she was never the same afterwards. She and Ellen have stayed very close at home since their mother&rsquo;s death. They don&rsquo;t often get to their own church at Lowbridge and I understand Ellen doesn&rsquo;t approve of going too often to a Presbyterian church. To the Methodist she NEVER goes, I&rsquo;ll say that much for her. That family of Wests have always been strong Episcopalians. Rosemary and Ellen are pretty well off. Rosemary doesn&rsquo;t really need to give music lessons. She does it because she likes to. They are distantly related to Leslie, you know. Are the Fords coming to the harbour this summer?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
