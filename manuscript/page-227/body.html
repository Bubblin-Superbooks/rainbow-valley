He had come home with dripping stockings and boots and had sat out the evening in them. He could not eat any breakfast and Faith made him go back to bed again. She and Una left the table as it was and went to Sunday School. There was no one in the school room when they got there and no one came. They waited until eleven and then went home.</p><p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody at the Methodist Sunday School either,&rdquo; said Una.</p></div> </div>
