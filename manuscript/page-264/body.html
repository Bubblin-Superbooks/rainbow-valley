<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She tried to talk to me one day about Aunt Martha being such a dirty housekeeper; and I wanted to say, &lsquo;Every one knows that YOU have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen wash-pan, Mrs. Leander Crawford!&rsquo; But I did not say it, Mrs. Dr. dear, because I have too much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of her. But I could tell worse things than THAT of Mrs. Leander Crawford, if I was disposed to gossip. And as for Mrs. Alec Davis, if she had said that to me, Mrs. Dr. dear, do you know what I would have said? I would have said, &lsquo;I have no doubt you would like to spank Faith, Mrs. Davis, but you will never have the chance to spank a minister&rsquo;s daughter either in this world or in that which is to come.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
