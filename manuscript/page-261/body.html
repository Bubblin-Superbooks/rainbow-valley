How hungry for love and fun I was&mdash;an unloved little drudge with never a chance to play! They do have such good times with the manse children.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about the poor pigs?&rdquo; asked Gilbert.</p><p>Anne tried to look sober and failed.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you really think it hurt them?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything could hurt those animals. They&rsquo;ve been the plague of the neighbourhood this summer and the Drews WON&rsquo;T shut them up. But I&rsquo;ll talk to Walter&mdash;if I can keep from laughing when I do it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
