<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The bleeding is worst of all&mdash;it&rsquo;s so ugly,&rdquo; cried Walter. &ldquo;It just made me sick when Jem cut his foot last summer. Susan said I looked more like fainting than Jem did. But I couldn&rsquo;t hear to see Jem hurt, either. Somebody is always getting hurt, Faith&mdash;and it&rsquo;s awful. I just can&rsquo;t BEAR to see things hurt. It makes me just want to run&mdash;and run&mdash;and run&mdash;till I can&rsquo;t hear or see them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use making a fuss over anyone getting hurt,&rdquo; said Faith, tossing her curls. &ldquo;Of course, if you&rsquo;ve hurt yourself very bad, you have to yell&mdash;and blood IS messy&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t like seeing other people hurt, either. But I don&rsquo;t want to run&mdash;I want to go to work and help them.</p></div> </div>
