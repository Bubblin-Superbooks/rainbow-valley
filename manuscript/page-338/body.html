<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Faith carried a heavy heart to bed with her that night. The thought of leaving the Glen was unbearable. Nowhere else in the world were there such chums as the Blythes. Her little heart had been wrung when they had left Maywater&mdash;she had shed many bitter tears when she parted with Maywater chums and the old manse there where her mother had lived and died. She could not contemplate calmly the thought of such another and harder wrench. She COULDN&rsquo;T leave Glen St. Mary and dear Rainbow Valley and that delicious graveyard.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful to be minister&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; groaned Faith into her pillow. &ldquo;Just as soon as you get fond of a place you are torn up by the roots. I&rsquo;ll never, never, NEVER marry a minister, no matter how nice he is.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
