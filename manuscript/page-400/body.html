<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h! Then you were certainly justified, Walter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s right to fight, sir?&rdquo; asked Walter curiously.</p><p>&ldquo;Not always&mdash;and not often&mdash;but sometimes&mdash;yes, sometimes,&rdquo; said John Meredith. &ldquo;When womenkind are insulted for instance&mdash;as in your case. My motto, Walter, is, don&rsquo;t fight till you&rsquo;re sure you ought to, and THEN put every ounce of you into it. In spite of sundry discolorations I infer that you came off best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I made him take it all back.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
