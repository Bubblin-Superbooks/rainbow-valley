<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosemary was quite used to being warned by Ellen from philandering if she so much as talked five minutes to any marriageable man under eighty or over eighteen. She had always laughed at the warning with unfeigned amusement. This time it did not amuse her&mdash;it irritated her a little. Who wanted to philander?</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a goose, Ellen,&rdquo; she said with unaccustomed shortness as she took her lamp. She went upstairs without saying goodnight.</p><p>Ellen shook her head dubiously and looked at the black cat.</p><p>&ldquo;What is she so cross about, St. George?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;When you howl you&rsquo;re hit, I&rsquo;ve always heard, George. But she promised, Saint&mdash;she promised, and we Wests always keep our word. So it won&rsquo;t matter if he does want to philander, George. She promised. I won&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
