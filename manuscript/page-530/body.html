It&rsquo;s awful cold down at the harbour mouth&mdash;long after it&rsquo;s warm up here,&rdquo; said Lida slyly.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re to keep them, of course. That is what I meant when I gave them. I have another pair of shoes and plenty of stockings.&rdquo;</p><p>Lida had meant to stay awhile and talk to the girls about many things. But now she thought she had better get away before somebody came and made her yield up her booty. So she shuffled off through the bitter twilight, in the noiseless, shadowy way she had slipped in. As soon as she was out of sight of the manse she sat down, took off the shoes and stockings, and put them in her herring basket. She had no intention of keeping them on down that dirty harbour road. They were to be kept good for gala occasions.</p></div> </div>
