<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;very good, indeed. I didn&rsquo;t think you were such a fighter, Walter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never fought before&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t want to right up to the last&mdash;and then,&rdquo; said Walter, determined to make a clean breast of it, &ldquo;I liked it while I was at it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Rev. John&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.</p><p>&ldquo;You were&mdash;a little frightened&mdash;at first?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was a whole lot frightened,&rdquo; said honest Walter. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to be frightened any more, sir. Being frightened of things is worse than the things themselves. I&rsquo;m going to ask father to take me over to Lowbridge to-morrow to get my tooth out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
