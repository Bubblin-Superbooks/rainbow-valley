When she had gone away, looking so proud and happy, the poor little thing, I remembered that all I had to wear were the horrid red and blue things Aunt Martha knit last winter for me out of some yarn that Mrs. Joseph Burr of Upper Glen sent us. It was dreadfully coarse yarn and all knots, and I never saw any of Mrs. Burr&rsquo;s own children wearing things made of such yarn. But Mary Vance says Mrs. Burr gives the minister stuff that she can&rsquo;t use or eat herself, and thinks it ought to go as part of the salary her husband signed to pay, but never does.</p></div> </div>
