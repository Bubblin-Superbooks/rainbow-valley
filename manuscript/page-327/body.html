<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Anne suddenly, coming back from dreamland. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t picture HER journey as being ended. Can YOU think of her sitting down and folding her hands&mdash;that eager, asking spirit of hers, with its fine adventurous outlook? No, I think in death she just opened a gate and went through&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;to new, shining adventures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;maybe,&rdquo; assented Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;Do you know, Anne dearie, I never was much taken with this everlasting rest doctrine myself&mdash;though I hope it isn&rsquo;t heresy to say so. I want to bustle round in heaven the same as here. And I hope there&rsquo;ll be a celestial substitute for pies and doughnuts&mdash;something that has to be MADE. Of course, one does get awful tired at times&mdash;and the older you are the tireder you get.</p></div> </div>
