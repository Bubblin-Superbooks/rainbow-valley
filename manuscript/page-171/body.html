And what is to become of this poor child now, Mrs. Marshall Elliott?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose she must be sent back to Hopetown,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;I think every one hereabouts who wants a home child has one. I&rsquo;ll see Mr. Meredith to-morrow and tell him my opinion of the whole affair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And no doubt she will, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; said Susan, after Miss Cornelia had gone. &ldquo;She would stick at nothing, not even at shingling the church spire if she took it into her head. But I cannot understand how even Cornelia Bryant can talk to a minister as she does. You would think he was just any common person.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
