<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll your children do then?&rdquo; asked Una. &ldquo;Children have to have porridge or they won&rsquo;t grow. Everybody says so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to get along without it or stay runts,&rdquo; retorted Faith stubbornly. &ldquo;Here, Una, you stir it while I set the table. If I leave it for a minute the horrid stuff will burn. It&rsquo;s half past nine. We&rsquo;ll be late for Sunday School.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone going past yet,&rdquo; said Una. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t likely be many out. Just see how it&rsquo;s pouring. And when there&rsquo;s no preaching the folks won&rsquo;t come from a distance to bring the children.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
