Only I do think it is not proper for them to play in a graveyard and that I will maintain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But they really play quite quietly there,&rdquo; excused Anne. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t run and yell as they do elsewhere. Such howls as drift up here from Rainbow Valley sometimes! Though I fancy my own small fry bear a valiant part in them. They had a sham battle there last night and had to &lsquo;roar&rsquo; themselves, because they had no artillery to do it, so Jem says. Jem is passing through the stage where all boys hanker to be soldiers.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
