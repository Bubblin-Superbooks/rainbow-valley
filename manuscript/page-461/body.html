I know that&mdash;but she promised, and she&rsquo;s got to keep her promise. I&rsquo;m rather sorry in some ways, St. George. I don&rsquo;t know of a man I&rsquo;d sooner have for a brother-in-law if a brother-in-law was convenient. I haven&rsquo;t a thing against him, Saint&mdash;not a thing except that he won&rsquo;t see and can&rsquo;t be made to see that the Kaiser is a menace to the peace of Europe. That&rsquo;s HIS blind spot. But he&rsquo;s good company and I like him. A woman can say anything she likes to a man with a mouth like John Meredith&rsquo;s and be sure of not being misunderstood. Such a man is more precious than rubies, Saint&mdash;and much rarer, George.</p></div> </div>
