<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Faith and Carl sat alone in the manse pew. Jerry had gone into the gallery to sit with a chum and the Blythe girls had taken Una with them. The Meredith children were given to &ldquo;sitting all over the church&rdquo; in this fashion and a great many people thought it very improper. The gallery especially, where irresponsible lads congregated and were known to whisper and suspected of chewing tobacco during service, was no place, for a son of the manse. But Jerry hated the manse pew at the very top of the church, under the eyes of Elder Clow and his family. He escaped from it whenever he could.</p><p>Carl, absorbed in watching a spider spinning its web at the window, did not notice Faith&rsquo;s legs. She walked home with her father after church and he never noticed them.</p></div> </div>
