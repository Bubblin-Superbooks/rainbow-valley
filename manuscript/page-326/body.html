He will not get a wife like Myra again in a hurry,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;Maybe he will not try, since his children are all grown up and Mirabel is able to keep house. But there is no predicting what a widower may or may not do and I, for one, will not try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss Myra terrible in church,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;She was such a worker. Nothing ever stumped HER. If she couldn&rsquo;t get over a difficulty she&rsquo;d get around it, and if she couldn&rsquo;t get around it she&rsquo;d pretend it wasn&rsquo;t there&mdash;and generally it wasn&rsquo;t. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep a stiff upper lip to my journey&rsquo;s end,&rsquo; said she to me once. Well, she has ended her journey.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
