<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not be buried at all,&rdquo; said Carl, &ldquo;but if I had to be I&rsquo;d like the ant-bed. Ants are AWF&rsquo;LY int&rsquo;resting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How very good all the people who are buried here must have been,&rdquo; said Una, who had been reading the laudatory old epitaphs. &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a single bad person in the whole graveyard. Methodists must be better than Presbyterians after all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe the Methodists bury their bad people just like they do cats,&rdquo; suggested Carl. &ldquo;Maybe they don&rsquo;t bother bringing them to the graveyard at all.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
