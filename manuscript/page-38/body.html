<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;Mrs. Reese, will you kindly return me that goose?&rsquo; Mrs. Reese &lsquo;returned&rsquo; it, as meek as Moses, but she must have been furious, for she had on her new silk dress. The worst of it is, she was a Methodist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I think that is better than if she was a Presbyterian,&rdquo; interjected Susan. &ldquo;If she had been a Presbyterian she would mostly likely have left the church and we cannot afford to lose our members. And Mrs. Reese is not liked in her own church, because she gives herself such great airs, so that the Methodists would be rather pleased that Mr. Meredith spoiled her dress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The point is, he made himself ridiculous, and I, for one, do not like to see my minister made ridiculous in the eyes of the Methodists,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia stiffly. &ldquo;If he had had a wife it would not have happened.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
