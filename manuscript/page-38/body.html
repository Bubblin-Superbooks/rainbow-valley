And no other manse children ever thought of playing there. Mr. Meredith shouldn&rsquo;t allow it. But he has always got his nose buried in a book, when he is home. He reads and reads, or walks about in his study in a day-dream. So far he hasn&rsquo;t forgotten to be in church on Sundays, but twice he has forgotten about the prayer-meeting and one of the elders had to go over to the manse and remind him. And he forgot about Fanny Cooper&rsquo;s wedding. They rang him up on the &lsquo;phone and then he rushed right over, just as he was, carpet slippers and all.</p></div> </div>
