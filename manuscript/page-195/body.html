Take Mary Vance! Do you mean keep her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;keep her&mdash;adopt her,&rdquo; said Una eagerly, gaining courage now that the ice was broken. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Elliott, PLEASE do. She doesn&rsquo;t want to go back to the asylum&mdash;she cries every night about it. She&rsquo;s so afraid of being sent to another hard place. And she&rsquo;s SO smart&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t anything she can&rsquo;t do. I know you wouldn&rsquo;t be sorry if you took her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
