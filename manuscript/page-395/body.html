<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was a loud clapping from the boys who were perched on the rail fence, but some of the girls were crying. They were frightened. They had seen schoolboy fights before, but nothing like Walter as he had grappled with Dan. There had been something terrifying about him. They thought he would kill Dan. Now that all was over they sobbed hysterically&mdash;except Faith, who still stood tense and crimson cheeked.</p><p>Walter did not stay for any conqueror&rsquo;s meed. He sprang over the fence and rushed down the spruce hill to Rainbow Valley. He felt none of the victor&rsquo;s joy, but he felt a certain calm satisfaction in duty done and honour avenged&mdash;mingled with a sickish qualm when he thought of Dan&rsquo;s gory nose. It had been so ugly, and Walter hated ugliness.</p></div> </div>
