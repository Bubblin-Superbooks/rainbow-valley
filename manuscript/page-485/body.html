There was no use arguing with her.</p><p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t release me, Ellen?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. And I won&rsquo;t talk of it again.

At any rate, don&rsquo;t let me hear any more of this nonsense. Go.&rdquo;</p><p>Rosemary went without another word, pale and spiritless. Ellen walked stormily about the room for a few minutes, then paused before the chair where St. George had been calmly sleeping through the whole evening. A reluctant smile overspread her dark face.</p></div> </div>
