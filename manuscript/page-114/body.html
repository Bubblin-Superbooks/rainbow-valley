<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Hell is an awful place,&rdquo; said Faith, with the dramatic enjoyment that is born of telling dreadful things. &ldquo;Bad people go there when they die and burn in fire for ever and ever and ever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; demanded Mary incredulously.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the Bible. And Mr. Isaac Crothers at Maywater told us, too, in Sunday School. He was an elder and a pillar in the church and knew all about it. But you needn&rsquo;t worry. If you&rsquo;re good you&rsquo;ll go to heaven and if you&rsquo;re bad I guess you&rsquo;d rather go to hell.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
