And I&rsquo;m honest. If I was going to run away I wasn&rsquo;t going to take what belong to HER that was worth anything. When I grow up I&rsquo;m going to have a blue sating dress. Your own clothes don&rsquo;t look so stylish. I thought ministers&rsquo; children were always dressed up.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
