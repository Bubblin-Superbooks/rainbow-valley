They are built of gold and diamonds&mdash;whole streets of diamonds, flashing like the sun. In the squares there are crystal fountains kissed by the light, and everywhere the asphodel blooms&mdash;the flower of heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I saw the main street in Charlottetown once and I thought it was real grand, but I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s nothing to heaven. Well, it all sounds gorgeous the way you tell it, but won&rsquo;t it be kind of dull, too?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
