She and Gilbert had laughed heartily and heartlessly over the front page of the Journal that day, but she knew that to dear Miss Cornelia it was almost a tragedy, and she must not wound her feelings by any display of levity.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful? What IS to be done?&rdquo; asked Miss Cornelia despairingly.
