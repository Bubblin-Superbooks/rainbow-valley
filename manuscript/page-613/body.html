And you brought up in the Glen. Well, wait a minute till I get by breath all back and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>Walter shivered delightsomely. He loved ghost stories. Their mystery, their dramatic climaxes, their eeriness gave him a fearful, exquisite pleasure. Longfellow instantly grew tame and commonplace. He threw the book aside and stretched himself out, propped upon his elbows to listen whole-heartedly, fixing his great luminous eyes on Mary&rsquo;s face. Mary wished he wouldn&rsquo;t look at her so. She felt she could make a better job of the ghost story if Walter were not looking at her. She could put on several frills and invent a few artistic details to enhance the horror.</p></div> </div>
