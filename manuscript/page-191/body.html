She has a great big house and Mr. Elliott is always wanting her to have help. It would be just a splendid place for Mary. Only she&rsquo;d have to behave herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan, do you think Mrs. Elliott would take her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any harm if you asked her,&rdquo; said Nan. At first Una did not think she could. She was so shy that to ask a favour of anybody was agony to her. And she was very much in awe of the bustling, energetic Mrs. Elliott. She liked her very much and always enjoyed a visit to her house; but to go and ask her to adopt Mary Vance seemed such a height of presumption that Una&rsquo;s timid spirit quailed.</p></div> </div>
