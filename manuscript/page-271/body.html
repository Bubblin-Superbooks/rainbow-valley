Then she laughed. &ldquo;Dear Miss Cornelia, they&rsquo;re only little children. And you KNOW they&rsquo;ve never yet done anything bad&mdash;they&rsquo;re just heedless and impulsive&mdash;as I was myself once. They&rsquo;ll grow sedate and sober&mdash;as I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p><p>Miss Cornelia laughed, too.</p><p>&ldquo;There are times, Anne dearie, when I know by your eyes that YOUR soberness is put on like a garment and you&rsquo;re really aching to do something wild and young again. Well, I feel encouraged. Somehow, a talk with you always does have that effect on me. Now, when I go to see Barbara Samson, it&rsquo;s just the opposite. She makes me feel that everything&rsquo;s wrong and always will be.</p></div> </div>
