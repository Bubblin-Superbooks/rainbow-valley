<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mary&rsquo;s a born worker. Sometimes I wonder which will wear out first&mdash;her legs or her tongue. I don&rsquo;t have enough to do to keep me out of mischief these days. I&rsquo;ll be real glad when school opens, for then I&rsquo;ll have something to do again. Mary doesn&rsquo;t want to go to school, but I put my foot down and said that go she must. I shall NOT have the Methodists saying that I kept her out of school while I lolled in idleness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
