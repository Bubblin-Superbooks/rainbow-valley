I want to have a talk with you. Bless the girl, what&rsquo;s she looking at me like that for? I don&rsquo;t want to eat you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had my supper. Sit down and be civil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can hear what you have to say quite as well here,&rdquo; said Rosemary.</p><p>&ldquo;So you can, girl, if you use your ears. I only wanted you to be comfortable. You look so durned uncomfortable, standing there. Well, I&rsquo;LL sit anyway.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
