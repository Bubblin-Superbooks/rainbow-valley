<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> God&rsquo;s good, anyhow so you say, so He won&rsquo;t do you any harm, but from all I can make out the devil needs to be pacified. I think the sensible way would be to say to HIM, &lsquo;Good devil, please don&rsquo;t tempt me. Just leave me alone, please.&rsquo; Now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, Mary. I&rsquo;m sure it couldn&rsquo;t be right to pray to the devil. And it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good because he&rsquo;s bad. It might aggravate him and he&rsquo;d be worse than ever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, as to this God-matter,&rdquo; said Mary stubbornly, &ldquo;since you and I can&rsquo;t settle it, there ain&rsquo;t no use in talking more about it until we&rsquo;ve a chanct to find out the rights of it. I&rsquo;ll do the best I can alone till then.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
