And one day last week, when she was all alone on the veranda, she heard the most awful shrieks of &lsquo;murder&rsquo; and &lsquo;help&rsquo; coming from the bush&mdash;positively frightful sounds, Anne dearie. Her heart gave out at once. Warren heard them himself at the barn, and went straight to the bush to investigate, and there he found all the manse children sitting on a fallen tree and screaming &lsquo;murder&rsquo; at the top of their lungs. They told him they were only in fun and didn&rsquo;t think anyone would hear them. They were just playing Indian ambush. Warren went back to the house and found his poor mother unconscious on the veranda.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
