It&rsquo;s SO nice when you can love people because so often you CAN&rsquo;T. Father said in his sermon last Sunday that we should love everybody. But how can we? How could we love Mrs. Alec Davis?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, father only said that in the pulpit,&rdquo; said Faith airily. &ldquo;He has more sense than to really think it outside.&rdquo;</p><p>The Blythe children went up to Ingleside, except Jem, who slipped away for a few moments on a solitary expedition to a remote corner of Rainbow Valley. Mayflowers grew there and Jem never forgot to take his mother a bouquet as long as they lasted.</p></div> </div>
