<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But Ellen lay savagely awake till morning.</p><p>There was no sulking, however. Rosemary was pale and quiet the next day, but beyond that Ellen could detect no difference in her. Certainly, she seemed to bear Ellen no grudge. It was stormy, so no mention was made of going to church. In the afternoon Rosemary shut herself in her room and wrote a note to John Meredith. She could not trust herself to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in person. She felt quite sure that if he suspected she was saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; reluctantly he would not take it for an answer, and she could not face pleading or entreaty. She must make him think she cared nothing at all for him and she could do that only by letter. She wrote him the stiffest, coolest little refusal imaginable. It was barely courteous; it certainly left no loophole of hope for the boldest lover&mdash;and John Meredith was anything but that.</p></div> </div>
