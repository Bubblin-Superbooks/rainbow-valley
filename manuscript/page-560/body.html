<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Then I tried my best to catch cold and really be sick by standing on the snowbank in the Methodist graveyard with my bare feet until Jerry pulled me off. But it didn&rsquo;t hurt me a bit and so I couldn&rsquo;t get out of going to church. So I just decided I would put my boots on and go that way. I can&rsquo;t see why it was so wrong and I was so careful to wash my legs just as clean as my face, but, anyway, father wasn&rsquo;t to blame for it. He was in the study thinking of his sermon and other heavenly things, and I kept out of his way before I went to Sunday School. Father does not look at people&rsquo;s legs in church, so of course he did not notice mine, but all the gossips did and talked about it, and that is why I am writing this letter to the Journal to explain.</p></div> </div>
