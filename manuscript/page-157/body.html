WHO is this creature who is staying at the manse and where does she come from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understood she was a little girl from over-harbour who was visiting at the manse,&rdquo; answered Anne, who saw the comical side of the codfish chase and secretly thought Rilla was rather vain and needed a lesson or two.</p><p>&ldquo;I know all the over-harbour families who come to our church and that imp doesn&rsquo;t belong to any of them,&rdquo; retorted Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;She is almost in rags and when she goes to church she wears Faith Meredith&rsquo;s old clothes. There&rsquo;s some mystery here, and I&rsquo;m going to investigate it, since it seems nobody else will. I believe she was at the bottom of their goings-on in Warren Mead&rsquo;s spruce bush the other day. Did you hear of their frightening his mother into a fit?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
