<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Stepmothers are AWFUL creatures,&rdquo; Mary went on. &ldquo;I could make your blood run cold if I was to tell you all I know about &lsquo;em. The Wilson kids across the road from Wiley&rsquo;s had a stepmother. She was just as bad to &lsquo;em as Mrs. Wiley was to me. It&rsquo;ll be awful if you get a stepmother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Una tremulously. &ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t marry anybody else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be hounded into it, I expect,&rdquo; said Mary darkly. &ldquo;All the old maids in the settlement are after him. There&rsquo;s no being up to them. And the worst of stepmothers is, they always set your father against you. He&rsquo;d never care anything about you again. He&rsquo;d always take her part and her children&rsquo;s part. You see, she&rsquo;d make him believe you were all bad.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
