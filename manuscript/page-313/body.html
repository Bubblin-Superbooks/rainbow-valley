It is the talk of the place. They aren&rsquo;t fed and dressed properly, and they&rsquo;re not trained at all. They have no more manners than a pack of wild Indians. You never think of doing your duty as a father. You let a stray child come here among them for a fortnight and never took any notice of her&mdash;a child that swore like a trooper I&rsquo;m told. YOU wouldn&rsquo;t have cared if they&rsquo;d caught small-pox from her.</p></div> </div>
