<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>John Meredith was startled by her loveliness and Rosemary was startled by his presence. She had never thought she would find anyone by that remote spring, least of all the recluse of Glen St. Mary manse. She almost dropped the heavy armful of books she was carrying home from the Glen lending library, and then, to cover her confusion, she told one of those small fibs which even the best of women do tell at times.</p><p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I came for a drink,&rdquo; she said, stammering a little, in answer to Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s grave &ldquo;good evening, Miss West.&rdquo; She felt that she was an unpardonable goose and she longed to shake herself. But John Meredith was not a vain man and he knew she would likely have been as much startled had she met old Elder Clow in that unexpected fashion.</p></div> </div>
