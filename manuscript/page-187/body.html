<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Cornelia had an interview with Mr. Meredith which proved something of a shock to that abstracted gentleman. She pointed out to him, none too respectfully, his dereliction of duty in allowing a waif like Mary Vance to come into his family and associate with his children without knowing or learning anything about her.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say there is much harm done, of course,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;This Mary-creature isn&rsquo;t what you might call bad, when all is said and done. I&rsquo;ve been questioning your children and the Blythes, and from what I can make out there&rsquo;s nothing much to be said against the child except that she&rsquo;s slangy and doesn&rsquo;t use very refined language. But think what might have happened if she&rsquo;d been like some of those home children we know of.</p></div> </div>
