I don&rsquo;t know what to make of your father, that&rsquo;s the long and short of it. He goes by me and never sees me in broad daylight. I ain&rsquo;t proud&mdash;but I ain&rsquo;t a door-mat, neither!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary, it&rsquo;s just father&rsquo;s way. Most of the time he never sees us, either. He is thinking deeply, that is all. And I AM going to pray that God will keep you in Four Winds&mdash;because I like you, Mary.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
