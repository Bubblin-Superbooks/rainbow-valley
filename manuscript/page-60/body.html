<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The ten year old Ingleside twins violated twin tradition by not looking in the least alike. Anne, who was always called Nan, was very pretty, with velvety nut-brown eyes and silky nut-brown hair. She was a very blithe and dainty little maiden&mdash;Blythe by name and blithe by nature, one of her teachers had said. Her complexion was quite faultless, much to her mother&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I have one daughter who can wear pink,&rdquo; Mrs. Blythe was wont to say jubilantly.</p><p>Diana Blythe, known as Di, was very like her mother, with gray-green eyes that always shone with a peculiar lustre and brilliancy in the dusk, and red hair. Perhaps this was why she was her father&rsquo;s favourite. She and Walter were especial chums; Di was the only one to whom he would ever read the verses he wrote himself&mdash;</p></div> </div>
