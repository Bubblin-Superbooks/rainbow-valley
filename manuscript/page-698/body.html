He isn&rsquo;t half so dreamy and absent-minded, believe me. I was so relieved when I heard that he had decided to close the manse and let the children visit round while he was away on his honeymoon. If he had left them and old Aunt Martha there alone for a month I should have expected to wake every morning and see the place burned down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aunt Martha and Jerry are coming here,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Carl is going to Elder Clow&rsquo;s. I haven&rsquo;t heard where the girls are going.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
