<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We can ask Jem Blythe to be umpire. He is the squarest boy in Glen St. Mary. But I guess we can settle our own affairs mostly. We want to keep this as much of a secret as we can. Don&rsquo;t breathe a word to Mary Vance. She&rsquo;d want to join and do the bringing up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Faith, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no use in spoiling every day by dragging punishments in. Let&rsquo;s have a punishment day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better choose Saturday because there is no school to interfere,&rdquo; suggested Una.</p><p>&ldquo;And spoil the one holiday in the week,&rdquo; cried Faith. &ldquo;Not much! No, let&rsquo;s take Friday. That&rsquo;s fish day, anyhow, and we all hate fish. We may as well have all the disagreeable things in one day. Then other days we can go ahead and have a good time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
