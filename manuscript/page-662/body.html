<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;St. George, this world would be a dull place without the men, I&rsquo;ll admit, but I&rsquo;m almost tempted to wish there wasn&rsquo;t one of &lsquo;em in it. Look at the trouble and bother they&rsquo;ve made right here, George&mdash;torn our happy old life completely up by the roots, Saint. John Meredith began it and Norman Douglas has finished it. And now both of them have to go into limbo. Norman is the only man I ever met who agrees with me that the Kaiser of Germany is the most dangerous creature alive on this earth&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t marry this sensible person because my sister is stubborn and I&rsquo;m stubborner. Mark my words, St. George, the minister would come back if she raised her little finger. But she won&rsquo;t George&mdash;she&rsquo;ll never do it&mdash;she won&rsquo;t even crook it&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t dare meddle, Saint.</p></div> </div>
