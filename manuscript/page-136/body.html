What DOES she do with all the cream?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She gives it to the cat. He&rsquo;s hers, you know,&rdquo; said Faith.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to CAT her,&rdquo; exclaimed Mary bitterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no use for cats anyhow. They belong to the old Nick. You can tell that by their eyes. Well, if old Martha won&rsquo;t, she won&rsquo;t, I s&rsquo;pose. But it gits on my nerves to see good vittles spoiled.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
