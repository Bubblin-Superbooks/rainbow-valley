Mrs. Jimmy Milgrave, whose pew was just in front of the manse pew, turned suddenly and looked the child over from top to toe. Mary, in a mere superfluity of naughtiness, stuck out her tongue at Mrs. Milgrave, much to Una&rsquo;s horror.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she declared after church. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d she want to stare at me like that for? Such manners! I&rsquo;m GLAD stuck my tongue out at her. I wish I&rsquo;d stuck it farther out. Say, I saw Rob MacAllister from over-harbour there. Wonder if he&rsquo;ll tell Mrs. Wiley on me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
