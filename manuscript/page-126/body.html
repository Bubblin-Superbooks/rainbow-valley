Let&rsquo;s both ask God to keep you from having to go back to Mrs. Wiley. You say your prayers, don&rsquo;t you Mary?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I always go over an old rhyme &lsquo;fore I get into bed,&rdquo; said Mary indifferently. &ldquo;I never thought of asking for anything in particular though. Nobody in this world ever bothered themselves about me so I didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose God would. He MIGHT take more trouble for you, seeing you&rsquo;re a minister&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
