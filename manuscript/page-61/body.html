<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Walter was a &ldquo;hop out of kin,&rdquo; as far as looks went. He did not resemble any known relative. He was quite the handsomest of the Ingleside children, with straight black hair and finely modelled features. But he had all his mother&rsquo;s vivid imagination and passionate love of beauty. Frost of winter, invitation of spring, dream of summer and glamour of autumn, all meant much to Walter.</p><p>In school, where Jem was a chieftain, Walter was not thought highly of. He was supposed to be &ldquo;girly&rdquo; and milk-soppish, because he never fought and seldom joined in the school sports, preferring to herd by himself in out of the way corners and read books&mdash;especially &ldquo;po&rsquo;try books.&rdquo; Walter loved the poets and pored over their pages from the time he could first read. Their music was woven into his growing soul&mdash;the music of the immortals.</p></div> </div>
