<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But we must remember, dear, that he didn&rsquo;t know that Adam had been a pet of yours. He thought he WAS just a common rooster. We must be just, even when we are terribly hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; admitted Faith. &ldquo;But why does everybody seem to think it funny that I should have loved Adam so much, Miss West? If it had been a horrid old cat nobody would have thought it queer. When Lottie Warren&rsquo;s kitten had its legs cut off by the binder everybody was sorry for her. She cried two days in school and nobody laughed at her, not even Dan Reese. And all her chums went to the kitten&rsquo;s funeral and helped her bury it&mdash;only they couldn&rsquo;t bury its poor little paws with it, because they couldn&rsquo;t find them. It was a horrid thing to have happen, of course, but I don&rsquo;t think it was as dreadful as seeing your pet EATEN UP. Yet everybody laughs at ME.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
