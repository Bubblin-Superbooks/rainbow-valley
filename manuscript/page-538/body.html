She uncoiled her bare, white legs from the tombstone and deliberately walked through the wet, cold grass to the bank of snow. Setting her teeth, she stepped upon it and stood there.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried Una aghast. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch your death of cold, Faith Meredith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to,&rdquo; answered Faith. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll catch a fearful cold and be AWFUL sick to-morrow. Then I won&rsquo;t be acting a lie. I&rsquo;m going to stand here as long as I can bear it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
