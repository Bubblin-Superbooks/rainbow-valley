At first Mary objected to the idea.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you go to church over-harbour?&rdquo; asked Una.</p><p>&ldquo;You bet. Mrs. Wiley never troubled church much, but I went every Sunday I could get off. I was mighty thankful to go to some place where I could sit down for a spell. But I can&rsquo;t go to church in this old ragged dress.&rdquo;</p><p>This difficulty was removed by Faith offering the loan of her second best dress.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s faded a little and two of the buttons are off, but I guess it&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
