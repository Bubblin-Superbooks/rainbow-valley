<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosemary stared again.</p><p>&ldquo;Una Meredith! Do you think I would do such a thing? Whatever put such an idea into your head?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mary Vance said stepmothers were all like that&mdash;and that they all hated their stepchildren and made their father hate them&mdash;she said they just couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;just being stepmothers made them like that&rdquo;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You poor child! And yet you came up here and asked me to marry your father because you wanted to make him happy? You&rsquo;re a darling&mdash;a heroine&mdash;as Ellen would say, you&rsquo;re a brick. Now listen to me, very closely, dearest. Mary Vance is a silly little girl who doesn&rsquo;t know very much and she is dreadfully mistaken about some things. I would never dream of trying to turn your father against you. I would love you all dearly.</p></div> </div>
