The place is full,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;D like that corner near the road, I guess. I could hear the teams going past and the people talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that little hollow under the weeping birch,&rdquo; said Una. &ldquo;That birch is such a place for birds and they sing like mad in the mornings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take the Porter lot where there&rsquo;s so many children buried. I like lots of company,&rdquo; said Faith. &ldquo;Carl, where&rsquo;d you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
