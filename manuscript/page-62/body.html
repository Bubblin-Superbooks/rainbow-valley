They are a pale misty blue, just like the haze in the valley. Oh, how I wish I could fly. It must be glorious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One does fly in dreams sometimes,&rdquo; said Di.</p><p>&ldquo;I never dream that I&rsquo;m flying exactly,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;But I often dream that I just rise up from the ground and float over the fences and the trees. It&rsquo;s delightful&mdash;and I always think, &lsquo;This ISN&rsquo;T a dream like it&rsquo;s always been before. THIS is real&rsquo;&mdash;and then I wake up after all, and it&rsquo;s heart-breaking.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
