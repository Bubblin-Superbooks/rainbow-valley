But Di is afraid of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Her brows are so black and she has such a great deep voice,&rdquo; said Di. &ldquo;Oh, how scared of her Kenneth Ford used to be when he was little! Mother says the first Sunday Mrs. Ford brought him to church Miss Ellen happened to be there, sitting right behind them. And the minute Kenneth saw her he just screamed and screamed until Mrs. Ford had to carry him out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is Mrs. Ford?&rdquo; asked Una wonderingly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the Fords don&rsquo;t live here. They only come here in the summer. And they&rsquo;re not coming this summer. They live in that little house &lsquo;way, &lsquo;way down on the harbour shore where father and mother used to lie. I wish you could see Persis Ford. She is just like a picture.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
