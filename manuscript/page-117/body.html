<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Aunt Martha hasn&rsquo;t had time to fix the spare room bed up yet, so she says; so NOBODY can sleep there, no matter how clean their heads are. And our room is so small, and the bed so small you can&rsquo;t sleep with us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can go back to the hay in the old barn for the night if you&rsquo;ll lend me a quilt,&rdquo; said Mary philosophically. &ldquo;It was kind of chilly last night, but &lsquo;cept for that I&rsquo;ve had worse beds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, you mustn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Una. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of a plan, Faith. You know that little trestle bed in the garret room, with the old mattress on it, that the last minister left there? Let&rsquo;s take up the spare room bedclothes and make Mary a bed there.</p></div> </div>
