I&rsquo;m always suspicious of widowers. They are not given to romantic ideas about friendship. They&rsquo;re apt to mean business. As for this Presbyterian man, what do they call him shy for? He&rsquo;s not a bit shy, though he may be absent-minded&mdash;so absent-minded that he forgot to say goodnight to ME when you started to go to the door with him. He&rsquo;s got brains, too. There&rsquo;s so few men round here that can talk sense to a body. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the evening. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing more of him. But no philandering, Rosemary, mind you&mdash;no philandering.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
