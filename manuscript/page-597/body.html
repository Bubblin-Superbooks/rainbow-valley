<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Good-Conduct Club had a special session the next morning before school. After various suggestions, it was decided that a fast day would be an appropriate punishment.</p><p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t eat a single thing for a whole day,&rdquo; said Jerry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of curious to see what fasting is like, anyhow. This will be a good chance to find out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What day will we choose for it?&rdquo; asked Una, who thought it would be quite an easy punishment and rather wondered that Jerry and Faith had not devised something harder.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pick Monday,&rdquo; said Faith. &ldquo;We mostly have a pretty FILLING dinner on Sundays, and Mondays meals never amount to much anyhow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
