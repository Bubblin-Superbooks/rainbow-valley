<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Fortunately, all the people the Merediths have offended so far are Methodists,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;That Jerry went to the Methodist prayer-meeting one night about a fortnight ago and sat beside old William Marsh who got up as usual and testified with fearful groans. &lsquo;Do you feel any better now?&rsquo; whispered Jerry when William sat down. Poor Jerry meant to be sympathetic, but Mr. Marsh thought he was impertinent and is furious at him. Of course, Jerry had no business to be in a Methodist prayer-meeting at all. But they go where they like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope they will not offend Mrs. Alec Davis of the Harbour Head,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;She is a very touchy woman, I understand, but she is very well off and pays the most of any one to the salary. I have heard that she says the Merediths are the worst brought up children she ever saw.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
