She understood and sympathized&mdash;really, she was almost as good as Mrs. Blythe&mdash;yes, quite as good.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Perry is a minister, but he should have been a BUTCHER,&rdquo; said Faith bitterly. &ldquo;He is so fond of carving things up. He ENJOYED cutting poor Adam to pieces. He just sliced into him as if he were any common rooster.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Between you and me, Faith, I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Perry very well myself,&rdquo; said Rosemary, laughing a little&mdash;but at Mr. Perry, not at Adam, as Faith clearly understood. &ldquo;I never did like him. I went to school with him&mdash;he was a Glen boy, you know&mdash;and he was a most detestable little prig even then. Oh, how we girls used to hate holding his fat, clammy hands in the ring-around games.</p></div> </div>
