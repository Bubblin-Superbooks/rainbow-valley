I was up last evening to arrange it with her. What a pretty girl she is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rosemary holds her own well. She isn&rsquo;t as young as she once was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought her very charming. I&rsquo;ve never had any real acquaintance with her, you know. Their house is so out of the way, and I&rsquo;ve seldom ever seen her except at church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People always have liked Rosemary West, though they don&rsquo;t understand her,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia, quite unconscious of the high tribute she was paying to Rosemary&rsquo;s charm. &ldquo;Ellen has always kept her down, so to speak. She has tyrannized over her, and yet she has always indulged her in a good many ways.</p></div> </div>
