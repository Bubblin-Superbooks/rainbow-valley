<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to take them,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;Of course, I was glad to, but Mary would have given me no peace till I asked them any way. The Ladies&rsquo; Aid is going to clean the manse from top to bottom before the bride and groom come back, and Norman Douglas has arranged to fill the cellar with vegetables. Nobody ever saw or heard anything quite like Norman Douglas these days, believe ME. He&rsquo;s so tickled that he&rsquo;s going to marry Ellen West after wanting her all his life. If I was Ellen&mdash;but then, I&rsquo;m not, and if she is satisfied I can very well be. I heard her say years ago when she was a schoolgirl that she didn&rsquo;t want a tame puppy for a husband. There&rsquo;s nothing tame about Norman, believe ME.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
