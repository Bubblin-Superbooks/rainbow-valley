<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t tell lies what&rsquo;s to become of me?&rdquo; said Mary with a sob. &ldquo;YOU don&rsquo;t understand. You don&rsquo;t know anything about it. You&rsquo;ve got a home and a kind father&mdash;though it does seem to me that he isn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n about half there. But anyway he doesn&rsquo;t lick you, and you get enough to eat such as it is&mdash;though that old aunt of yours doesn&rsquo;t know ANYTHING about cooking. Why, this is the first day I ever remember of feeling &lsquo;sif I&rsquo;d enough to eat. I&rsquo;ve been knocked about all of my life, &lsquo;cept for the two years I was at the asylum. They didn&rsquo;t lick me there and it wasn&rsquo;t too bad, though the matron was cross. She always looked ready to bite my head off a nail. But Mrs. Wiley is a holy terror, that&rsquo;s what SHE is, and I&rsquo;m just scared stiff when I think of going back to her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
