Miss Ellen thought it all a good joke, and said she hadn&rsquo;t had as much fun in church for years. Of course THEY don&rsquo;t care&mdash;they are Episcopalians. But we Presbyterians feel it. And there were so many hotel people there that night and scores of Methodists. Mrs. Leander Crawford cried, she felt so bad. And Mrs. Alec Davis said the little hussy ought to be spanked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leander Crawford is always crying in church,&rdquo; said Susan contemptuously. &ldquo;She cries over every affecting thing the minister says.
