I&rsquo;m just going to walk past and never take the least notice of him. You watch me!&rdquo;</p><p>Faith accordingly stalked past Dan with her chin out and an expression of scorn that bit into his soul. He turned and shouted after her.</p><p>&ldquo;Pig-girl! Pig-girl!! Pig-girl!!!&rdquo; in a crescendo of insult.</p><p>Faith walked on, seemingly oblivious. But her lip trembled slightly with a sense of outrage. She knew she was no match for Dan Reese when it came to an exchange of epithets. She wished Jem Blythe had been with her instead of Walter. If Dan Reese had dared to call her a pig-girl in Jem&rsquo;s hearing, Jem would have wiped up the dust with him. But it never occurred to Faith to expect Walter to do it, or blame him for not doing it. Walter, she knew, never fought other boys.</p></div> </div>
