<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Cornelia came up to Ingleside that evening to relieve her feelings over Sunday night. To her surprise she found that Anne did not view Faith&rsquo;s performance in quite the same light as she did.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought there was something brave and pathetic in her getting up there before that churchful of people, to confess,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You could see she was frightened to death&mdash;yet she was bound to clear her father. I loved her for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, the poor child meant well,&rdquo; sighed Miss Cornelia, &ldquo;but just the same it was a terrible thing to do, and is making more talk than the house-cleaning on Sunday. THAT had begun to die away, and this has started it all up again.</p></div> </div>
