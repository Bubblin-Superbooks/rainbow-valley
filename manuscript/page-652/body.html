I knew it would only take a minute. Now, girl, you go home and tell Ellen, and we&rsquo;ll have a wedding in a fortnight and you&rsquo;ll come and live with us. We shan&rsquo;t leave you to roost on that hill-top like a lonely crow&mdash;don&rsquo;t you worry. I know you hate me, but, Lord, it&rsquo;ll be great fun living with some one that hates me. Life&rsquo;ll have some spice in it after this. Ellen will roast me and you&rsquo;ll freeze me. I won&rsquo;t have a dull moment.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
