She merely said in her fretful mumbling way, &ldquo;What foolishness are you young rips up to now?&rdquo; and thought no more about it.

Half of the time he forgot it and there was no one to remind him of it. Breakfast&mdash;Aunt Martha&rsquo;s breakfast&mdash;was not a hard meal to miss. Even the hungry &ldquo;young rips&rdquo; did not feel it any great deprivation to abstain from the &ldquo;lumpy porridge and blue milk&rdquo; which had aroused the scorn of Mary Vance.
