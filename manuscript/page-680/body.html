<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Una went upstairs. Carl and Faith were already on their way through the early moonlight to Rainbow Valley, having heard therefrom the elfin lilt of Jerry&rsquo;s jews-harp and having guessed that the Blythes were there and fun afoot. Una had no wish to go. She sought her own room first where she sat down on her bed and had a little cry. She did not want anybody to come in her dear mother&rsquo;s place. She did not want a stepmother who would hate her and make her father hate her. But father was so desperately unhappy&mdash;and if she could do any anything to make him happier she MUST do it. There was only one thing she could do&mdash;and she had known the moment she had left the study that she must do it. But it was a very hard thing to do.</p></div> </div>
