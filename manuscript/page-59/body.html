<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Walter cherished the ambition to be a poet himself some day. The thing could be done. A certain Uncle Paul&mdash;so called out of courtesy&mdash;who lived now in that mysterious realm called &ldquo;the States,&rdquo; was Walter&rsquo;s model. Uncle Paul had once been a little school boy in Avonlea and now his poetry was read everywhere. But the Glen schoolboys did not know of Walter&rsquo;s dreams and would not have been greatly impressed if they had. In spite of his lack of physical prowess, however, he commanded a certain unwilling respect because of his power of &ldquo;talking book talk.&rdquo; Nobody in Glen St. Mary school could talk like him. He &ldquo;sounded like a preacher,&rdquo; one boy said; and for this reason he was generally left alone and not persecuted, as most boys were who were suspected of disliking or fearing fisticuffs.</p></div> </div>
