Despite her awe of Walter she revelled in his &ldquo;book talk.&rdquo; It always gave her a delightful sensation. Walter had been reading his Coleridge that day, and he pictured a heaven where</p><p>&ldquo;There were gardens bright with sinuous rills Where blossomed many an incense bearing tree, And there were forests ancient as the hills Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any woods in heaven,&rdquo; said Mary, with a long breath. &ldquo;I thought it was all streets&mdash;and streets&mdash;AND streets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course there are woods,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;Mother can&rsquo;t live without trees and I can&rsquo;t, so what would be the use of going to heaven if there weren&rsquo;t any trees?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
