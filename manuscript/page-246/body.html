I wasn&rsquo;t at Sunday School because I had toothache, but every one else was and they saw all your stuff out on the lawn. And Elder Abraham and Mrs. Elder Abraham saw you shaking rugs in the graveyard.&rdquo;</p><p>Una sat down among the daisies and began to cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Jem resolutely, &ldquo;this thing must be cleared up.

How could you have thought Saturday was Sunday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prayer-meeting was Thursday night,&rdquo; cried Faith, &ldquo;and Adam flew into the soup-pot on Friday when Aunt Martha&rsquo;s cat chased him, and spoiled our dinner; and Saturday there was a snake in the cellar and Carl caught it with a forked stick and carried it out, and Sunday it rained.
