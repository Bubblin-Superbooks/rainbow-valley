<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To sit in Rainbow Valley, steeped in a twilight half gold, half amethyst, rife with the odours of balsam-fir and woodsy growing things in their springtime prime, with the pale stars of wild strawberry blossoms all around you, and with the sough of the wind and tinkle of bells in the shaking tree tops, and eat fried trout and dry bread, was something which the mighty of earth might have envied them.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit in,&rdquo; invited Nan, as Jem placed his sizzling tin platter of trout on the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn to say grace, Jem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my part frying the trout,&rdquo; protested Jem, who hated saying grace. &ldquo;Let Walter say it. He LIKES saying grace. And cut it short, too, Walt. I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
