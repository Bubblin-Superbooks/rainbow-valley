<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Even Anne seldom questioned her decisions, much to the disgust of Mrs. Rachel Lynde of Green Gables, who gloomily told Anne, whenever she visited Four Winds, that she was letting Susan get to be entirely too much of a boss and would live to rue it.</p><p>&ldquo;Here is Cornelia Bryant coming up the harbour road, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;She will be coming up to unload three months&rsquo; gossip on us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Anne, hugging her knees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving for Glen St. Mary gossip, Susan. I hope Miss Cornelia can tell me everything that has happened while we&rsquo;ve been away&mdash;EVERYTHING&mdash;who has got born, or married, or drunk; who has died, or gone away, or come, or fought, or lost a cow, or found a beau. It&rsquo;s so delightful to be home again with all the dear Glen folks, and I want to know all about them.</p></div> </div>
