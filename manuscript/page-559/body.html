<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t bear to wear those hateful stockings. They were so ugly and rough and felt so scratchy. Everybody would have made fun of me. I thought at first I&rsquo;d pretend to be sick and not go to church next day, but I decided I couldn&rsquo;t do that, because it would be acting a lie, and father told us after mother died that was something we must never, never do. It is just as bad to act a lie as to tell one, though I know some people, right here in the Glen, who act them, and never seem to feel a bit bad about it. I will not mention any names, but I know who they are and so does father.</p></div> </div>
