<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is the only window we can see it from,&rdquo; said Una. &ldquo;I love to watch it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you? So do I. I could see it from the Wiley loft and it was the only comfort I had. When I was all sore from being licked I&rsquo;d watch it and forget about the places that hurt. I&rsquo;d think of the ships sailing away and away from it and wish I was on one of them sailing far away too&mdash;away from everything. On winter nights when it didn&rsquo;t shine, I just felt real lonesome. Say, Una, what makes all you folks so kind to me when I&rsquo;m just a stranger?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
