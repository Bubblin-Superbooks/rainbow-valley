<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So I lit out Thursday morning &lsquo;fore Mrs. Wiley was up and walked to the Glen&mdash;six miles. And when I got to the station I found I&rsquo;d lost my money. Dunno how&mdash;dunno where. Anyhow, it was gone. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. If I went back to old Lady Wiley she&rsquo;d take the hide off me. So I went and hid in that old barn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what will you do now?&rdquo; asked Jerry.</p><p>&ldquo;Dunno. I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to go back and take my medicine. Now that I&rsquo;ve got some grub in my stomach I guess I can stand it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
