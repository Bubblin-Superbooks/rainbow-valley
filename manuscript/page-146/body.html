<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No-o-o, I guess not. But I THINK they were sometimes spanked when they were small.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A spanking doesn&rsquo;t amount to anything,&rdquo; said Mary contemptuously. &ldquo;If my folks had just spanked me I&rsquo;d have thought they were petting me. Well, it ain&rsquo;t a fair world. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking my share of wallopings but I&rsquo;ve had a darn sight too many.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t right to say that word, Mary,&rdquo; said Una reproachfully. &ldquo;You promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;way,&rdquo; responded Mary. &ldquo;If you knew some of the words I COULD say if I liked you wouldn&rsquo;t make such a fuss over darn. And you know very well I hain&rsquo;t ever told any lies since I come here.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
