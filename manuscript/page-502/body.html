Well, it&rsquo;s getting dark and I must scoot home. Mrs. Elliott doesn&rsquo;t like me to be out after dark. Laws, when I lived with Mrs. Wiley the dark was just the same as the daylight to me. I didn&rsquo;t mind it no more&rsquo;n a gray cat. Them days seem a hundred years ago. Now, you mind what I&rsquo;ve said and try to behave yourselves, for you pa&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;LL always back you up and defend you&mdash;you can be dead sure of that. Mrs. Elliott says she never saw the like of me for sticking up for my friends. I was real sassy to Mrs. Alec Davis about you and Mrs. Elliott combed me down for it afterwards. The fair Cornelia has a tongue of her own and no mistake.</p></div> </div>
