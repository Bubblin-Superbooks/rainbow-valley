They send for him from everywhere when they want to dig a well. And I believe I know the Wandering Jew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary,&rdquo; said Una, awe-struck.</p><p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;true&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re alive. There was an old man at Mrs. Wiley&rsquo;s one day last fall. He looked old enough to be ANYTHING. She was asking him about cedar posts, if he thought they&rsquo;d last well. And he said, &lsquo;Last well? They&rsquo;ll last a thousand years. I know, for I&rsquo;ve tried them twice.&rsquo; Now, if he was two thousand years old who was he but your Wandering Jew?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
