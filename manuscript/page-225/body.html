But there&rsquo;s no preaching in their Church to-day, either, so likely their Sunday School is in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>Una washed the dishes, doing them quite nicely, for so much had she learned from Mary Vance. Faith swept the floor after a fashion and peeled the potatoes for dinner, cutting her finger in the process.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish we had something for dinner besides ditto,&rdquo; sighed Una. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired of it. The Blythe children don&rsquo;t know what ditto is. And we NEVER have any pudding. Nan says Susan would faint if they had no pudding on Sundays. Why aren&rsquo;t we like other people, Faith?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
