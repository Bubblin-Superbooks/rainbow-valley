Don&rsquo;t take any of the ungodly black liquid&mdash;here&rsquo;s some milk for you. What did you say your name was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Faith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No name that&mdash;no name that! I can&rsquo;t stomach such a name. Got any other?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like the name, don&rsquo;t like it. There&rsquo;s no smeddum to it. Besides, it makes me think of my Aunt Jinny. She called her three girls Faith, Hope, and Charity. Faith didn&rsquo;t believe in anything&mdash;Hope was a born pessimist&mdash;and Charity was a miser. You ought to be called Red Rose&mdash;you look like one when you&rsquo;re mad. I&rsquo;LL call you Red Rose. And you&rsquo;ve roped me into promising to go to church? But only once a month, remember&mdash;only once a month.</p></div> </div>
