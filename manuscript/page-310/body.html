<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Was this woman, whose vulgarity and consciousness of money oozed out of her at every pore, actually asking him to give her Una&mdash;his dear little wistful Una with Cecilia&rsquo;s own dark-blue eyes&mdash;the child whom the dying mother had clasped to her heart after the other children had been led weeping from the room. Cecilia had clung to her baby until the gates of death had shut between them. She had looked over the little dark head to her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;Take good care of her, John,&rdquo; she had entreated. &ldquo;She is so small&mdash;and sensitive. The others can fight their way&mdash;but the world will hurt HER. Oh, John, I don&rsquo;t know what you and she are going to do. You both need me so much. But keep her close to you&mdash;keep her close to you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
