<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;If He&rsquo;s as good as your father He&rsquo;ll do for me,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;When your father was talking to me I felt as if I never could be bad any more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d talk to father about Him,&rdquo; sighed Una. &ldquo;He can explain it all so much better than I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, so I will, next time he wakes up,&rdquo; promised Mary. &ldquo;That night he talked to me in the study he showed me real clear that my praying didn&rsquo;t kill Mrs. Wiley. My mind&rsquo;s been easy since, but I&rsquo;m real cautious about praying. I guess the old rhyme is the safest. Say, Una, it seems to me if one has to pray to anybody it&rsquo;d be better to pray to the devil than to God.</p></div> </div>
