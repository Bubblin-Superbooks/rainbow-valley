I said I WANTED to run. That&rsquo;s a different thing. I want to help people, too. But oh, I wish there weren&rsquo;t any ugly, dreadful things in the world.

You wouldn&rsquo;t have toothache if you were dead, but still, wouldn&rsquo;t you lots rather be alive than dead? I would, a hundred times. Oh, here&rsquo;s Dan Reese.
