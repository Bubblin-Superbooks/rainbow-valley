To be called &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; as if she were no bigger than chubby Rilla Blythe over at Ingleside! It was insufferable. And how that abominable Mr. Perry did eat!

Faith felt that if that awful repast did not soon come to an end she would wind it up by throwing something at Mr. Perry&rsquo;s gleaming head. Fortunately, Mr. Perry found Aunt Martha&rsquo;s leathery apple pie too much even for his powers of mastication and the meal came to an end, after a long grace in which Mr. Perry offered up devout thanks for the food which a kind and beneficent Providence had provided for sustenance and temperate pleasure.</p></div> </div>
