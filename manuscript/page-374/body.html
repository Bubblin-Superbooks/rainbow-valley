Luckily it WAS good.</p><p>&ldquo;Best plum jam in the world,&rdquo; said Norman, filling a large saucer and plumping it down before her. &ldquo;Glad you like it. I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of jars to take home with you. There&rsquo;s nothing mean about me&mdash;never was. The devil can&rsquo;t catch me at THAT corner, anyhow. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault that Hester didn&rsquo;t have a new hat for ten years. It was her own&mdash;she pinched on hats to save money to give yellow fellows over in China. I never gave a cent to missions in my life&mdash;never will. Never you try to bamboozle me into that! A hundred a year to the salary and church once a month&mdash;but no spoiling good heathens to make poor Christians! Why, girl, they wouldn&rsquo;t be fit for heaven or hell&mdash;clean spoiled for either place&mdash;clean spoiled.</p></div> </div>
