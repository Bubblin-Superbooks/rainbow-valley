<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You won&rsquo;t mind sleeping in the garret, will you, Mary? It&rsquo;s just above our room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Any place&rsquo;ll do me. Laws, I never had a decent place to sleep in my life. I slept in the loft over the kitchen at Mrs. Wiley&rsquo;s. The roof leaked rain in the summer and the snow druv in in winter. My bed was a straw tick on the floor. You won&rsquo;t find me a mite huffy about where I sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>The manse garret was a long, low, shadowy place, with one gable end partitioned off. Here a bed was made up for Mary of the dainty hemstitched sheets and embroidered spread which Cecilia Meredith had once so proudly made for her spare-room, and which still survived Aunt Martha&rsquo;s uncertain washings. The good nights were said and silence fell over the manse.</p></div> </div>
