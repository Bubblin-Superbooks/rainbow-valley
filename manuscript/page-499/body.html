Your pa goes to see Rosemary West. SHE is going to be your step-ma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; cried Una, flushing crimson.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno. I just go by what folks say. I don&rsquo;t give it for a fact. But it would be a good thing. Rosemary West&rsquo;d make you toe the mark if she came here, I&rsquo;ll bet a cent, for all she&rsquo;s so sweet and smiley on the face of her. They&rsquo;re always that way till they&rsquo;ve caught them. But you need some one to bring you up. You&rsquo;re disgracing your pa and I feel for him. I&rsquo;ve always thought an awful lot of your pa ever since that night he talked to me so nice. I&rsquo;ve never said a single swear word since, or told a lie.</p></div> </div>
