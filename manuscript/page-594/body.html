Pitch into us hard&mdash;we deserve a regular combing down.&rdquo;</p><p>But Mr. Meredith did no combing down or pitching into. He sat down and gathered his small culprits close to him and talked a little to them, tenderly and wisely. They were overcome with remorse and shame, and felt that they could never be so silly and thoughtless again.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to punish ourselves good and hard for this,&rdquo; whispered Jerry as they crept upstairs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a session of the Club first thing tomorrow and decide how we&rsquo;ll do it. I never saw father so cut up.</p></div> </div>
