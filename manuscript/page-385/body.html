<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; agreed Una. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t stay to-morrow to watch the fight.

I&rsquo;m going to tie my colours on his arm&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing to do when he&rsquo;s my knight. How lucky Mrs. Blythe gave me that pretty blue hair-ribbon for my birthday! I&rsquo;ve only worn it twice so it will be almost new. But I wish I was sure Walter would win. It will be so&mdash;so HUMILIATING if he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
