But while I live and move and have my being I set my own bread, believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is Mary getting on?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no fault to find with Mary,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia rather gloomily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s getting some flesh on her bones and she&rsquo;s clean and respectful&mdash;though there&rsquo;s more in her than I can fathom. She&rsquo;s a sly puss. If you dug for a thousand years you couldn&rsquo;t get to the bottom of that child&rsquo;s mind, believe ME! As for work, I never saw anything like her. She EATS it up. Mrs. Wiley may have been cruel to her, but folks needn&rsquo;t say she made Mary work.</p></div> </div>
