Mr. Meredith had had a bad time getting a switch to suit him. He cut one, then felt it was too slender. Carl had done a really indefensible thing. Then he cut another&mdash;it was far too thick. After all, Carl had thought the eel was dead. The third one suited him better; but as he picked it up from the table it seemed very thick and heavy&mdash;more like a stick than a switch.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold out your hand,&rdquo; he said to Carl.</p><p>Carl threw back his head and held out his hand unflinchingly. But he was not very old and he could not quite keep a little fear out of his eyes.</p></div> </div>
