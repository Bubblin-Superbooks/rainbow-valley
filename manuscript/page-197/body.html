<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Miss Cornelia was alone on the veranda. Una had hoped Mr. Elliott would be there. He was so big and hearty and twinkly that there would be encouragement in his presence. She sat on the little stool Miss Cornelia brought out and tried to eat the doughnut Miss Cornelia gave her. It stuck in her throat, but she swallowed desperately lest Miss Cornelia be offended. She could not talk; she was still pale; and her big, dark-blue eyes looked so piteous that Miss Cornelia concluded the child was in some trouble.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, dearie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something, that&rsquo;s plain to be seen.&rdquo;</p><p>Una swallowed the last twist of doughnut with a desperate gulp.</p></div> </div>
