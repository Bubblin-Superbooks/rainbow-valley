He was very pale, but his eyes blazed.</p><p>&ldquo;You hold your tongue, Dan Reese!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Miss Walter,&rdquo; retorted Dan, not at all abashed. He vaulted airily to the top of the rail fence and chanted insultingly,</p><p>&ldquo;Cowardy, cowardy-custard Stole a pot of mustard, Cowardy, cowardy-custard!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a coincidence!&rdquo; said Walter scornfully, turning still whiter. He had only a very hazy idea what a coincidence was, but Dan had none at all and thought it must be something peculiarly opprobrious.</p></div> </div>
