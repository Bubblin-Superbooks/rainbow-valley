<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I wish we were a blacksmith&rsquo;s children,&rdquo; protested Faith angrily, hunting for her stockings. &ldquo;THEN people wouldn&rsquo;t expect us to be better than other children. JUST look at the holes in my heels. Mary darned them all up before she went away, but they&rsquo;re as bad as ever now. Una, get up. I can&rsquo;t get the breakfast alone. Oh, dear. I wish father and Jerry were home. You wouldn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d miss father much&mdash;we don&rsquo;t see much of him when he is home. And yet EVERYTHING seems gone. I must run in and see how Aunt Martha is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she any better?&rdquo; asked Una, when Faith returned.</p></div> </div>
