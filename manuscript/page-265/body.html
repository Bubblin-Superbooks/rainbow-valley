But that dress looked dreadful, as she stood there upon the platform.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was clean, though, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;They ARE clean children. They may be very heedless and reckless, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I am not saying they are not, but they NEVER forget to wash behind their ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea of Faith forgetting what day was Sunday,&rdquo; persisted Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;She will grow up just as careless and impractical as her father, believe ME. I suppose Carl would have known better if he hadn&rsquo;t been sick. I don&rsquo;t know what was wrong with him, but I think it very likely he had been eating those blueberries that grew in the graveyard. No wonder they made him sick. If I was a Methodist I&rsquo;d try to keep my graveyard cleaned up at least.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
