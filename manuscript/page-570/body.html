<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Cornelia Elliott thinks she was born to run this world, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; she had once said to Anne, &ldquo;and so she is always in a stew over something. I have never thought I was, and so I go calmly along. Not but what it has sometimes occurred to me that things might be run a little better than they are. But it is not for us poor worms to nourish such thoughts. They only make us uncomfortable and do not get us anywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that anything can be done&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo; said Anne, pulling out a nice, cushiony chair for Miss Cornelia. &ldquo;But how in the world did Mr. Vickers allow that letter to be printed? Surely he should have known better.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
