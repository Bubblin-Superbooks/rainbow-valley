She and Miss Rosemary sat on the old pine until the twilight crept softly down over the white valley and the evening star shone over the gray maple grove.

Faith was telling Una of her meeting with Rosemary.</p><p>&ldquo;She is just lovely, I think,&rdquo; said Faith. &ldquo;Just as nice as Mrs. Blythe&mdash;but different.
