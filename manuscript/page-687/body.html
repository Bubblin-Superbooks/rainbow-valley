She must be perfectly frank and sincere with the child.</p><p>&ldquo;Una, dear,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t because of you poor little souls that I cannot be your father&rsquo;s wife. I never thought of such a thing. You are not bad&mdash;I never supposed you were. There&mdash;there was another reason altogether, Una.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like father?&rdquo; asked Una, lifting reproachful eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Miss West, you don&rsquo;t know how nice he is.
