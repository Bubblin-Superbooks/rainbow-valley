<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Walter shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;a raging one. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink&mdash;so I just paced up and down the floor and imagined I was an early Christian martyr being tortured at the command of Nero. That helped ever so much for a while&mdash;and then I got so bad I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you cry?&rdquo; asked Faith anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but I lay down on the floor and groaned,&rdquo; admitted Walter. &ldquo;Then the girls came in and Nan put cayenne pepper in it&mdash;and that made it worse&mdash;Di made me hold a swallow of cold water in my mouth&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, so they called Susan. Susan said it served me right for sitting up in the cold garret yesterday writing poetry trash. But she started up the kitchen fire and got me a hot-water bottle and it stopped the toothache.</p></div> </div>
