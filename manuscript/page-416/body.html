And I&rsquo;M good to her, too,&rdquo; retorted Mary. &ldquo;I work like a nigger to make it easy for her and have everything just as she likes it. We was made for each other. &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t every one could get along with her as well as I do. She&rsquo;s pizen neat, but so am I, and so we agree fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told you she would never whip you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you did. She&rsquo;s never tried to lay a finger on me and I ain&rsquo;t never told a lie to her&mdash;not one, true&rsquo;s you live. She combs me down with her tongue sometimes though, but that just slips off ME like water off a duck&rsquo;s back. Say, Una, why didn&rsquo;t you hang on to the muff?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
