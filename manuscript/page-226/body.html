<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be like other people,&rdquo; laughed Faith, tying up her bleeding finger. &ldquo;I like being myself. It&rsquo;s more interesting. Jessie Drew is as good a housekeeper as her mother, but would you want to be as stupid as she is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But our house isn&rsquo;t right. Mary Vance says so. She says people talk about it being so untidy.&rdquo;</p><p>Faith had an inspiration.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll clean it all up,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right to work to-morrow. It&rsquo;s a real good chance when Aunt Martha is laid up and can&rsquo;t interfere with us. We&rsquo;ll have it all lovely and clean when father comes home, just like it was when Mary went away. ANY ONE can sweep and dust and wash windows. People won&rsquo;t be able to talk about us any more.</p></div> </div>
