For instance, at school the teacher says they are model children. But at home they simply run wild.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What about Mrs. Meredith?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s NO Mrs. Meredith. That is just the trouble. Mr. Meredith is a widower. His wife died four years ago. If we had known that I don&rsquo;t suppose we would have called him, for a widower is even worse in a congregation than a single man. But he was heard to speak of his children and we all supposed there was a mother, too. And when they came there was nobody but old Aunt Martha, as they call her. She&rsquo;s a cousin of Mr. Meredith&rsquo;s mother, I believe, and he took her in to save her from the poorhouse. She is seventy-five years old, half blind, and very deaf and very cranky.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
