<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be here to burden you long,&rsquo; she would tell her family with a groan. And if any of them ventured to talk about their little future plans she&rsquo;d groan also and say, &lsquo;Ah, I won&rsquo;t be here then.&rsquo; When I went to see her I always agreed with her and it made her so mad that she was always quite a lot better for several days afterwards. She has better health now but no more cheerfulness. Myra was so different. She was always doing or saying something to make some one feel good. Perhaps the men they married had something to do with it. Luella&rsquo;s man was a Tartar, believe ME, while Jim Murray was decent, as men go. He looked heart-broken to-day. It isn&rsquo;t often I feel sorry for a man at his wife&rsquo;s funeral, but I did feel for Jim Murray.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
