I hope you are as happy as you look.&rsquo;&rdquo; sighed Susan. &ldquo;She had not changed much. That dress she wore was the black satin she got for her daughter&rsquo;s wedding fourteen years ago. Her Aunt told her then to keep it for her funeral, but Myra laughed and said, &lsquo;I may wear it to my funeral, Aunty, but I will have a good time out of it first.&rsquo; And I may say she did. Myra Murray was not a woman to attend her own funeral before she died.</p></div> </div>
