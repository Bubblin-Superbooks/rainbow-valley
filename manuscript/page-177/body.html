And still you&rsquo;ll sit here and wait&mdash;and WAIT.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, dry up,&rdquo; said Mary, shivering. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like that, Walter Blythe. You give me the creeps. Do you want to set me bawling? I could just see that horrid old Piper going away on, and you boys following him, and us girls sitting here waiting all alone. I dunno why it is&mdash;I never was one of the blubbering kind&mdash;but as soon as you start your spieling I always want to cry.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
