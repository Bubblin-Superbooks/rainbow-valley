<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why, I remember wondering, as I walked through Westminster Abbey which of her two especial beaux Millicent Drew would finally marry. Do you know, Susan, I have a dreadful suspicion that I love gossip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, of course, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; admitted Susan, &ldquo;every proper woman likes to hear the news. I am rather interested in Millicent Drew&rsquo;s case myself. I never had a beau, much less two, and I do not mind now, for being an old maid does not hurt when you get used to it. Millicent&rsquo;s hair always looks to me as if she had swept it up with a broom. But the men do not seem to mind that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
