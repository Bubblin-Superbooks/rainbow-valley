<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Shirley, &ldquo;the little brown boy,&rdquo; as he was known in the family &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who,&rdquo; was asleep in Susan&rsquo;s arms. He was brown-haired, brown-eyed and brown-skinned, with very rosy cheeks, and he was Susan&rsquo;s especial love. After his birth Anne had been very ill for a long time, and Susan &ldquo;mothered&rdquo; the baby with a passionate tenderness which none of the other children, dear as they were to her, had ever called out. Dr. Blythe had said that but for her he would never have lived.</p><p>&ldquo;I gave him life just as much as you did, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; Susan was wont to say. &ldquo;He is just as much my baby as he is yours.&rdquo; And, indeed, it was always to Susan that Shirley ran, to be kissed for bumps, and rocked to sleep, and protected from well-deserved spankings.</p></div> </div>
