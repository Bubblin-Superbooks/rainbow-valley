<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In Mr. James Reese&rsquo;s buckwheat stubble-land, with its beautiful tones of red and brown, a crow parliament was being held, whereat solemn deliberations regarding the welfare of crowland were in progress. Faith cruelly broke up the august assembly by climbing up on the fence and hurling a broken rail at it. Instantly the air was filled with flapping black wings and indignant caws.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; said Walter reproachfully. &ldquo;They were having such a good time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I hate crows,&rdquo; said Faith airily. &ldquo;The are so black and sly I feel sure they&rsquo;re hypocrites. They steal little birds&rsquo; eggs out of their nests, you know. I saw one do it on our lawn last spring. Walter, what makes you so pale to-day? Did you have the toothache again last night?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
