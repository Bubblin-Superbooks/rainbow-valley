I would never have asked you to give me back my promise&mdash;never&mdash;but I had to tell Norman why I couldn&rsquo;t marry him and he said HE would ask you. I couldn&rsquo;t prevent him. You need not suppose you are the only person in the world who possesses self-respect. I never dreamed of marrying and leaving you here alone. And you&rsquo;ll find I can be as determined as yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Rosemary turned away and went into the house, with a shrug of her shoulders. Ellen looked down at St. George, who had never blinked an eyelash or stirred a whisker during the whole interview.</p></div> </div>
