<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosemary West was always called a &ldquo;sweet woman.&rdquo; She was so sweet that even her high-bred, stately air had never gained for her the reputation of being &ldquo;stuck-up,&rdquo; which it would inevitably have done in the case of anyone else in Glen St. Mary. Life had taught her to be brave, to be patient, to love, to forgive. She had watched the ship on which her lover went sailing out of Four Winds Harbour into the sunset. But, though she watched long, she had never seen it coming sailing back. That vigil had taken girlhood from her eyes, yet she kept her youth to a marvellous degree. Perhaps this was because she always seemed to preserve that attitude of delighted surprise towards life which most of us leave behind in childhood&mdash;an attitude which not only made Rosemary herself seem young, but flung a pleasing illusion of youth over the consciousness of every one who talked to her.</p></div> </div>
