<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mary had gone a few steps with the Blythe girls when Una suddenly turned and ran after her.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some gum for you, Mary,&rdquo; she said, with a little repentant catch in her voice, thrusting all her four knots into Mary&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad you have such a pretty muff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, thanks,&rdquo; said Mary, rather taken by surprise. To the Blythe girls, after Una had gone, she said, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a queer little mite? But I&rsquo;ve always said she had a good heart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
