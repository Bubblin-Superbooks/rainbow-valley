<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, to come back to earth,&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia, &ldquo;who can we get to take Myra&rsquo;s class in Sunday School? Julia Clow has been teaching it since Myra took ill, but she&rsquo;s going to town for the winter and we&rsquo;ll have to get somebody else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard that Mrs. Laurie Jamieson wanted it,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;The Jamiesons have come to church very regularly since they moved to the Glen from Lowbridge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;New brooms!&rdquo; said Miss Cornelia dubiously. &ldquo;Wait till they&rsquo;ve gone regularly for a year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot depend on Mrs. Jamieson a bit, Mrs. Dr. dear,&rdquo; said Susan solemnly. &ldquo;She died once and when they were measuring her for her coffin, after laying her out just beautiful, did she not go and come back to life! Now, Mrs. Dr. dear, you know you CANNOT depend on a woman like that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
