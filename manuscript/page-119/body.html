<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Una was just falling asleep when she heard a sound in the room just above that made her sit up suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Faith&mdash;Mary&rsquo;s crying,&rdquo; she whispered. Faith replied not, being already asleep. Una slipped out of bed, and made her way in her little white gown down the hall and up the garret stairs. The creaking floor gave ample notice of her coming, and when she reached the corner room all was moonlit silence and the trestle bed showed only a hump in the middle.</p><p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; whispered Una.</p><p>There was no response.</p></div> </div>
