I know I would just have loved to see Jimmy Perry&rsquo;s coat-tails burning up. It must have been fun.&rdquo;</p><p>Both laughed; but Faith ended with a bitter little sigh.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, Adam is dead and I am NEVER going to love anything again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, dear. We miss so much out of life if we don&rsquo;t love. The more we love the richer life is&mdash;even if it is only some little furry or feathery pet. Would you like a canary, Faith&mdash;a little golden bit of a canary? If you would I&rsquo;ll give you one. We have two up home.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
