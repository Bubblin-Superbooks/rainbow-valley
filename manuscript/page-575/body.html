For my part, I never detested Norman as some folks do. He could never over-crow ME. I DO wonder what started him coming to church. I have never been able to believe Mrs. Wilsons&rsquo;s story that Faith Meredith went there and bullied him into it. I&rsquo;ve always intended to ask Faith herself, but I&rsquo;ve never happened to think of it just when I saw her. What influence could SHE have over Norman Douglas? He was in the store when I left, bellowing with laughter over that scandalous letter. You could have heard him at Four Winds Point. &lsquo;The greatest girl in the world,&rsquo; he was shouting.</p></div> </div>
