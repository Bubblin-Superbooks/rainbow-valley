<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Una got home Faith was lying face downwards on her bed, utterly refusing to be comforted. Aunt Martha had killed Adam. He was reposing on a platter in the pantry that very minute, trussed and dressed, encircled by his liver and heart and gizzard. Aunt Martha heeded Faith&rsquo;s passion of grief and anger not a whit.</p><p>&ldquo;We had to have something for the strange minister&rsquo;s dinner,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too big a girl to make such a fuss over an old rooster. You knew he&rsquo;d have to be killed sometime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell father when he comes home what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; sobbed Faith.</p></div> </div>
