At times I feel stifled down there in the Glen. You can breathe up here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is calm to-night,&rdquo; said Rosemary laughing. &ldquo;If there were a wind it would blow your breath away. We get &lsquo;a&rsquo; the airts the wind can blow&rsquo; up here. This place should be called Four Winds instead of the Harbour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like wind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A day when there is no wind seems to me DEAD. A windy day wakes me up.&rdquo; He gave a conscious laugh. &ldquo;On a calm day I fall into day dreams. No doubt you know my reputation, Miss West. If I cut you dead the next time we meet don&rsquo;t put it down to bad manners. Please understand that it is only abstraction and forgive me&mdash;and speak to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
