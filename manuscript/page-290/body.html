The millenniun isn&rsquo;t THAT near, Mr. Meredith, and YOU don&rsquo;t think it is any more than I do. As for this Kaiser, mark my words, he is going to make a heap of trouble&rdquo;&mdash;and Miss Ellen prodded her book emphatically with her long finger. &ldquo;Yes, if he isn&rsquo;t nipped in the bud he&rsquo;s going to make trouble. WE&rsquo;LL live to see it&mdash;you and I will live to see it, Mr. Meredith. And who is going to nip him? England should, but she won&rsquo;t. WHO is going to nip him? Tell me that, Mr. Meredith.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
