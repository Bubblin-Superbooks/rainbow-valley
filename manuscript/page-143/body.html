She learned to play on the jew&rsquo;s-harp and soon eclipsed Jerry.</p><p>&ldquo;Never struck anything yet I couldn&rsquo;t do if I put my mind to it,&rdquo; she declared. Mary seldom lost a chance of tooting her own horn.

And when they all went picking gum in Rainbow Valley Mary always got &ldquo;the biggest chew&rdquo; and bragged about it.
