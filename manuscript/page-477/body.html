She disliked so much to be alone that thinking aloud was one of her devices for circumventing unwelcome solitude. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful never to have a man-body with some brains to talk to once in a while. And like as not he&rsquo;ll never come near the house again. There&rsquo;s Norman Douglas, too&mdash;I like that man, and I&rsquo;d like to have a good rousing argument with him now and then. But he&rsquo;d never dare come up for fear people would think he was courting me again&mdash;for fear I&rsquo;D think it, too, most likely&mdash;though he&rsquo;s more a stranger to me now than John Meredith. It seems like a dream that we could ever have been beaus.</p></div> </div>
