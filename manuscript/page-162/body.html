Oh, yes, Mrs. Dr. dear, she found it, in the goose at the dinner-table, mixed up with the stuffing. Do you think a woman like that would do for a minister&rsquo;s mother-in-law? I do not. But no doubt I would be better employed in mending little Jem&rsquo;s trousers than in talking gossip about my neighbours. He tore them something scandalous last night in Rainbow Valley.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Walter?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p><p>&ldquo;He is up to no good, I fear, Mrs. Dr. dear. He is in the attic writing something in an exercise book. And he has not done as well in arithmetic this term as he should, so the teacher tells me. Too well I know the reason why. He has been writing silly rhymes when he should have been doing his sums. I am afraid that boy is going to be a poet, Mrs. Dr. dear.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
