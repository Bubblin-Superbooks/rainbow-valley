<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As soon as I felt better I told Susan my poetry wasn&rsquo;t trash and she wasn&rsquo;t any judge. And she said no, thank goodness she was not and she did not know anything about poetry except that it was mostly a lot of lies. Now you know, Faith, that isn&rsquo;t so. That is one reason why I like writing poetry&mdash;you can say so many things in it that are true in poetry but wouldn&rsquo;t be true in prose. I told Susan so, but she said to stop my jawing and go to sleep before the water got cold, or she&rsquo;d leave me to see if rhyming would cure toothache, and she hoped it would be a lesson to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the dentist at Lowbridge and get the tooth out?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
