And some of &lsquo;em are cowards. They got so scared they just doubled theirselves up into a ball and let the other fellows bang &lsquo;em. They wouldn&rsquo;t put up a fight at all. Some of &lsquo;em are lazy and won&rsquo;t work. We watched &lsquo;em shirking. And there was one ant died of grief &lsquo;cause another ant got killed&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t work&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t eat&mdash;just died&mdash;it did, honest to Go&mdash;oodness.&rdquo;</p><p>A shocked silence prevailed. Every one knew that Mary had not started out to say &ldquo;goodness.&rdquo; Faith and Di exchanged glances that would have done credit to Miss Cornelia herself. Walter and Carl looked uncomfortable and Una&rsquo;s lip trembled.</p></div> </div>
