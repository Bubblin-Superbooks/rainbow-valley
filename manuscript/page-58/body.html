He never broke a promise. He was not a great talker. His teachers did not think him brilliant, but he was a good, all-round student. He never took things on faith; he always liked to investigate the truth of a statement for himself. Once Susan had told him that if he touched his tongue to a frosty latch all the skin would tear off it. Jem had promptly done it, &ldquo;just to see if it was so.&rdquo; He found it was &ldquo;so,&rdquo; at the cost of a very sore tongue for several days. But Jem did not grudge suffering in the interests of science.</p></div> </div>
